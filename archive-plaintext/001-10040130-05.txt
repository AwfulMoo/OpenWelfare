+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Scenario 1                        | Job seeker states they were       |
|                                   | working on the incident date and  |
|                                   | contacted the provider to advise  |
|                                   | of inability to attend. When      |
|                                   | asked, the job seeker immediately |
|                                   | provides details of the name of   |
|                                   | the employment consultant she     |
|                                   | notified, what date, and what     |
|                                   | approximate time.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Hours for One Period (HOP)    |
|                                   | field on the EAPP screen confirms |
|                                   | the job seeker declared 30 hours  |
|                                   | of work for the applicable        |
|                                   | fortnight.                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Employment Income Summary     |
|                                   | (EANS) screen confirms declared   |
|                                   | earnings for 30 hours for the     |
|                                   | applicable fortnight. There are   |
|                                   | minimal instances of              |
|                                   | non-compliance on the job         |
|                                   | seeker's Compliance Summary,      |
|                                   | indicating they have a good       |
|                                   | history of attending appointments |
|                                   | and complying with requirements.  |
|                                   | The provider has entered notes of |
|                                   | previous contacts to reschedule   |
|                                   | appointments due to job seeker    |
|                                   | contacts advising they will be    |
|                                   | working, but not for this         |
|                                   | compliance event.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The job seeker appears genuinely  |
|                                   | upset an investigation is taking  |
|                                   | place. Given their manner and     |
|                                   | engagement during this compliance |
|                                   | investigation, record of the      |
|                                   | hours worked on the EAPP screen   |
|                                   | and their previous history of     |
|                                   | reporting when they are working,  |
|                                   | there is no reason to doubt the   |
|                                   | job seeker's statement,           |
|                                   | particularly as the job seeker    |
|                                   | was able to advise when they      |
|                                   | contacted and who they spoke      |
|                                   | with. Therefore, a greater weight |
|                                   | can be given to the evidence of   |
|                                   | the job seeker statement as a     |
|                                   | credible source.                  |

|                                   | (PST)-skilled Service Officer     |
|                                   | must document the evidence and    |
|                                   | how this was weighed, for         |
|                                   | example, 'job seeker statement is |
|                                   | credible given past compliance    |
|                                   | and prior notification of         |
|                                   | inability to attend for previous  |
|                                   | instances as per the Provider     |
|                                   | Recorded Information screen and   |
|                                   | factual account of who they       |
|                                   | reported their inability to       |
|                                   | attend to. Statement is also      |
|                                   | supported by the hours worked     |
|                                   | history.'                         |

| Scenario 2                        | During their initial contact with |
|                                   | the Participation Solutions Team  |
|                                   | (PST) to discuss a work refusal   |
|                                   | failure, the job seeker advised   |
|                                   | they would be able to provide     |
|                                   | additional evidence to support    |
|                                   | their statements. An allowance of |
|                                   | 2 days was negotiated for the job |
|                                   | seeker to provide the evidence.   |
|                                   | At the end of the 2 days the      |
|                                   | additional evidence had not been  |
|                                   | received, and the job seeker      |
|                                   | could not be contacted to explore |
|                                   | why. The decision about the       |
|                                   | compliance action was made, based |
|                                   | on the available evidence. As     |
|                                   | some facts had not been           |
|                                   | substantiated these were given    |
|                                   | less weight.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The decision maker's explanation  |
|                                   | of decision states as the         |
|                                   | requested evidence had not been   |
|                                   | provided the facts could not be   |
|                                   | substantiated and were            |
|                                   | disregarded in the decision       |

| Scenario 3                        | A Workforce Australia job seeker  |
|                                   | advised they did not attend a     |

|                                   | for the Dole (WFD) requirement    |
|                                   | due to being in court on that     |
|                                   | day. The job seeker advised they  |
|                                   | spoke to their provider a week    |
|                                   | prior to let them know of their   |
|                                   | inability to attend.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The report from the provider      |
|                                   | noted an ongoing legal case and   |
|                                   | court attendance is a known       |
|                                   | circumstance that may impact the  |
|                                   | job seeker's ability to comply,   |
|                                   | however, the job seeker is        |
|                                   | required to attend WFD which had  |
|                                   | been arranged around court dates. |
|                                   | The Workforce Australia provider  |
|                                   | noted the job seeker did not      |
|                                   | advise of inability to attend on  |
|                                   | the incident date and had not     |

|                                   | Due to conflicting statements,    |
|                                   | the Participation Solutions Team  |
|                                   | (PST)-skilled Service Officer was |
|                                   | not reasonably satisfied prior    |
|                                   | contact had occurred. The Service |
|                                   | Officer contacted the provider    |
|                                   | who confirmed the job seeker      |
|                                   | contacted the week prior to       |
|                                   | advise they would be in court on  |
|                                   | Tuesday. However, the incident    |
|                                   | date was Thursday, 2 days later.  |
|                                   | The provider had recorded a       |
|                                   | Personal Event for the Tuesday.   |
|                                   | The provider confirmed there had  |
|                                   | been no contact from the job      |
|                                   | seeker since the call the week    |
|                                   | before. The job seeker had been   |
|                                   | unable to provide details of the  |
|                                   | time, date or person they spoke   |
|                                   | with.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A greater weight is given to the  |
|                                   | providers' evidence as their      |
|                                   | notes were well documented and    |
|                                   | thus the evidence was more fully  |
|                                   | substantiated, they were aware of |
|                                   | the job seeker's legal issues and |
|                                   | can confidently recall the        |
|                                   | previous conversation. The job    |
|                                   | seeker's statement was given less |
|                                   | weighting as it was considered    |
|                                   | the less credible in this case.   |

|                                   | resulting in the generation of a  |
