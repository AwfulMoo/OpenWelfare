This document outlines information on processing a grant for Carer
Payment (CP) when the carer is currently receiving Carer Allowance (CA)
and they have an existing absence recorded on the system.

Carer Allowance recipients with existing recorded absences

When a carer applies for CP and they are already receiving CA, they may
have an existing absence recorded on the system due to:

-   hospitalisation
-   respite care
-   education
-   training, or
-   treatment

In these cases, the existing absence must be deleted and then
re-recorded so it can be taken into account for both CA and CP.
