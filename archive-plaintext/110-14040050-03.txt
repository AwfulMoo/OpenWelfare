Determining reviewable independence categories for ABSTUDY

Independent rate of ABY for RSS ABSTUDY

Table 1: This table describes the documents required by RSS to verify
entitlement to the independent rate of ABSTUDY.

Customers who are currently assessed as independent at the time of
selection for RSS do not need to re-verify their circumstances, as long
as nothing has changed

If the customerâ€™s circumstances have changed or if the customer is being
assessed for the first time, verification may be required.
