|                                   | discretion to treat the customer  |
|                                   | as still unemployed. In these     |
|                                   | cases, the customer is operating  |

|                                   | that is, self-employed rather     |
|                                   | than an employee. Therefore,      |
|                                   | income from the contract is       |
|                                   | treated as business income, and   |
