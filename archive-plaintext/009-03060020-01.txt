This document outlines the CTAT process for carers in receipt of CP
and/or CA when the child is turning 16 years of age (or 18 years for CP
child with a terminal condition).

CTAT invitation letter

Carers are sent a CTAT invitation letter when their child care receiver
turns:

-   15 years and 6 months
-   or 17 years and 9 months (for a child with a terminal condition)

The invitation letter:

invites the carer to submit a transfer to CP and/or CA for an adult care
receiver. Note: carers can only submit a transfer for the payment they
currently receive. For example, if the carer currently only receives CA,
they cannot apply to transfer to CP

advises the carer to submit their transfer by the due date if they want
their payments to be assessed under adult provisions

informs the carer of the cancellation date of:

-   child payment, or
-   Health Care Card (HCC) only CA (child)

Note: prior to 1 July 2022 CTAT invitations were generally sent when the
child turned 15 years and 9 months. Most carers with a child born
between 1 October 2006 and 31 December 2006 inclusive were sent an
invitation on 1 July 2022.

CTAT due dates

If the child was born before 1 January 2007, the CTAT will be due by the
time the child is:

-   16 years for CA Health Care Card (HCC) only
-   16 years 3 months for CP, and/or CA

If the child was born on or after 1 January 2007, the CTAT will be due
when the child is 16 years for CP and/or CA (including CA HCC only).

If the carer is being paid Carer Payment for a child with a terminal
illness, the CTAT will be due when the child turns 18 years.

Short term/episodic care period

Carers who receive CP for a child with a short term or episodic
condition will be invited to submit a CTAT. However the CTAT must be
processed as a new claim and should only be processed when the short
term or episodic medical certificate has expired.

Payment guarantee

The payment guarantee applies for carers of children born on or after 1
January 2007 (or 1 April 2005 if the carer is being paid Carer Payment
for a child with a terminal illness).

If the carer submits their completed CTAT on or before the child turns
16 years, they will continue to receive CA and/or CP until the CTAT is
processed, even if it is not processed until after the child turns 16
years and 3 months (or 18 years if terminal).

The payment guarantee does not apply to CA HCC only.

Outcome of CTAT for Carer Allowance (CA) Health Care Card (HCC) only

The outcome of the CTAT will be to either:

-   cancel CA HCC when child turns 16 years, 3 months and 1 day (or 16
    years if born before 1 January 2007), or
-   grant CA under the adult rules from the later date of when the child
    turned 16 years, or CTAT was submitted

Outcome of CTAT for Carer Payment (CP) for a child with a terminal illness

The outcome of the CTAT will be to:

-   continue CP and/or CA under the adult rules

If the child is born on or after 1 April 2005, the date of effect for
the decision is the later date of when:

-   child turns 18 years and 1 day, or
-   the CTAT is processed

If the child is born before 1 April 2005, the date of effect for the
decision is the date the child turns 18 years.

(PCC).

Outcome of CTAT for CP and CA payment level - child born on or after 1 January 2007

The carer will continue to be paid under the child rules up to and
including the day the child turns 16 years and 3 months. They will
continue to be paid under the child rules past this date until the CTAT
is processed if they submitted the CTAT on or before the child turned 16
years.

The outcome of the CTAT will be to:

-   Cancel CP and CA
-   Continue CP and/or CA under adult rules

The date of effect for the decision is the later date of when:

Ex Carer Allowance Health Care Card for child

The child can claim for an Ex Carer Allowance Health Care Card. They can
do this even if the carer does not submit a CTAT.

Reminder message

There are 2 different reminders carers may get about their CTAT:

-   when a carer has answered the questions in their CTAT task and all
    required tasks have been completed but the CTAT remains not
    submitted. This will be sent to their myGov inbox or via SMS message
-   2 months before the CTAT is due, carers will be automatically sent a
    reminder message if they have not yet submitted a CTAT. This will be
    sent to their myGov inbox, via SMS message or letter
