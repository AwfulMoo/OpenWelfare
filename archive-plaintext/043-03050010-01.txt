This document outlines the factors used in determining the nature of
business of commission sales persons, and how income is assessed for
commission sales persons who are considered to be self-employed.

Determining if a customer is self-employed or an employee

As a general policy, a person who is employed on a commission basis to
sell a product and/or recruit other commission salespersons, is employed
under a contract for service and is self-employed. If the employment
contract is a contract of service then the person is an employee.

People who can generally be characterised as self-employed include
consultants and distributors involved in Avon, Tupperware, Amway and
similar products or businesses.

If a person is regarded as self-employed they are considered to be a
person who carries on a business. The income assessed is the gross
income less allowable deductions that is, it is the net profit earned by
the business after deductions, not gross income of the business, which
is assessable as income of the customer.
