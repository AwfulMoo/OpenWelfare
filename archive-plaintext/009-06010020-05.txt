| Example                           | Description                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Sam was admitted to a local       |
|                                   | hospital and was diagnosed with a |
|                                   | terminal condition. Sam was then  |
|                                   | transferred to the hospital's     |
|                                   | palliative care unit.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sam's partner, Jenny, lodges a    |
|                                   | claim for CA and advises these    |
|                                   | details. Jenny also indicates on  |
|                                   | the claim form of attending the   |
|                                   | hospital every day and providing  |
|                                   | care to Sam. In this situation,   |
|                                   | Jenny's claim would be assessed   |
|                                   | using the hospitalisation         |
|                                   | provisions.                       |
