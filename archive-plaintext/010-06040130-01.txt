This document outlines the process to assess a tertiary student studying
overseas for Youth Allowance (YA) at the away from home rate.

Away from home rate and studying overseas

Many students have the option (and in some cases the requirement) to
study part of their course overseas. This usually involves a semester or
year of study. Where this study can be considered an approved course for
YA, the student may be eligible for payment at the away from home rate.

Eligibility for the away from home rate

For the purpose of YA, study overseas can be considered study in an
approved course if:

-   the student remains enrolled with their Australian institution, and
-   it is counted by their Australian institution towards the gaining of
    their Australian qualification

The study must satisfy the activity test, which includes making
satisfactory progress.

The away from home rate of YA is payable for the approved period the
student needs to live away from home to study overseas.

These criteria do not apply to secondary 'exchange' students or students
who study via correspondence and choose to live overseas.

The Resources page contains information about payment of the away from
home rate of YA when a customer is studying overseas.
