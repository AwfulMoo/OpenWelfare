| 1                                 | DSP terminally ill customer       |
|                                   | leaving Australia, inability to   |
|                                   | work occurred while resident of   |

|                                   | Pete arrived in Australia from    |
|                                   | South Africa in May 1986. Pete    |
|                                   | has lived in Australia            |
|                                   | continuously and was granted DSP  |
|                                   | in 2016 after being diagnosed     |
|                                   | with cancer in 2014. The          |
|                                   | prognosis is poor and Pete's      |
|                                   | treating doctor has provided new  |
|                                   | medical evidence which indicates  |
|                                   | life expectancy of 18 months to 2 |
|                                   | years. Pete is departing          |
|                                   | Australia on 3 December 2018 for  |
|                                   | South Africa to spend time with   |
|                                   | family and is unsure about the    |
|                                   | return date.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Pete's departure should be        |
|                                   | treated as permanent. DSP payment |
|                                   | is portable for as long as Pete   |
|                                   | remains overseas. An assessment   |
|                                   | of the terminally ill condition   |
|                                   | is not required as Pete is a      |
|                                   | recent grant and the condition is |
|                                   | considered terminal.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Pete's inability to work occurred |
|                                   | during the period of being a      |
|                                   | resident of Australia and         |
|                                   | therefore the payment will not be |
|                                   | proportional after 26 weeks       |
|                                   | absence.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Add-ons will cease on Pete's      |
|                                   | departure.                        |

|                                   | Marty was born in Romania and     |
|                                   | came to Australia in 1985. Marty  |
|                                   | lived and worked in Australia for |
|                                   | 10 years then returned to         |
|                                   | Romania. Marty was employed in    |
|                                   | Romania for 4 years before        |
|                                   | ceasing work because of an        |
|                                   | accident. Marty returned to live  |
|                                   | in Australia in 2009 and was      |
|                                   | granted DSP in 2010. In February  |
|                                   | 2018 Marty advised of an          |
|                                   | intention to return to live       |
|                                   | permanently in Romania with       |
|                                   | family after receiving            |
|                                   | confirmation of having terminal   |
|                                   | cancer and was only expected to   |
|                                   | live a few more months.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Before deciding to leave          |
|                                   | Australia permanently, Marty      |
|                                   | contacted Services Australia for  |
|                                   | information and was sent the form |
|                                   | for the doctor to complete. The   |
|                                   | completed form provided evidence  |
|                                   | confirming Marty's condition.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The payment is portable for as    |
|                                   | long as Marty remains outside     |
|                                   | Australia.                        |

|                                   | Although Marty was diagnosed with |
|                                   | cancer while a resident of        |
|                                   | Australia, the actual inability   |
|                                   | to work (the DSP qualifying       |
|                                   | event) occurred whilst residing   |
|                                   | in Romania. Therefore, after 26   |
|                                   | weeks, the pension will be        |
|                                   | proportional based on Marty's own |
|                                   | working life residence of about   |
|                                   | 19 years.                         |

|                                   | Jamie was diagnosed with cancer   |
|                                   | last year and has decided to go   |
|                                   | to the UK and Europe on 14 August |
|                                   | for 12 months before becoming too |
|                                   | ill to travel. Jamie's treating   |
|                                   | doctor has confirmed that the     |
|                                   | condition is terminal within 2    |
|                                   | years. Even though Jamie has a    |
|                                   | terminal medical condition, the   |
|                                   | planned travel does not satisfy   |
|                                   | the terminally ill portability    |
|                                   | provisions due to neither leaving |
|                                   | Australia to live in another      |
|                                   | country, nor going overseas to be |
|                                   | with family or friends.           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, as the condition is      |
|                                   | terminal, and therefore manifest, |
|                                   | Jamie will satisfy the 'no future |

|                                   | provisions without the            |
