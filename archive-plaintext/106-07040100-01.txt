This document outlines how to verify a customer's proof of arrival in
Australia. Proof of arrival is used for the customer's commencement of
identity when the customer is born outside Australia. The confirmation
of commencement of identity is important in the determination of a
customer's eligibility for most Centrelink administered payments.

This procedure is no longer current. It has been replaced by Assessing
if a customer is an Australian resident. This page will be removed in
