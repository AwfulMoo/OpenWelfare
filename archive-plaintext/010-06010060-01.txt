When to use the form

Youth Allowance and ABSTUDY: Statement by Young Person (SY015) is used
to obtain further information from those customers who do not live with
their parents because:

of extreme family breakdown or similar exceptional circumstances

it would be unreasonable to expect the customer to live at home as there
would be a serious risk to their physical or mental well-being due to
family and domestic violence, sexual abuse or other similar unreasonable
circumstances

the parents are unable to provide the customer with a suitable home
because they lack stable accommodation, and

the customer is not receiving:

-   continuous support (financial or otherwise) from a parent or any
    other person who is acting as a long-term guardian
-   continuous payments in the way of income support from the Australian
    Government or a state or territory authority

Customers 18 years of age and over

Customers 18 years and over must supply 2 statements:

-   Statement by Young person (SY015)
-   Statement by Parents (SY016)

For claimants 18 years and over, an assessment of a young person's
entitlement to the unreasonable to live at home rate of payment is done
by Service Officers within the O18 UTLAH Assessment Teams that process
these claims. These customers will generally be assessed via statement
forms (as above) only.

Customers under 18 years of age

YA and ABSTUDY customers under 18 years of age who are applying for
independence due to unreasonable to live at home (UTLAH) are not
required to complete the SY015 or SY016. Instead, they are to be booked
in for an interview with a social worker. The social worker must make
the assessment of the young person's entitlement.
