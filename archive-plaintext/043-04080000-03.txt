|                                   | If assets are sold for less than  |
|                                   | their market value this           |
|                                   | effectively reduces the asset     |
|                                   | attribution amount for the trust  |
|                                   | or company and as a result the    |
|                                   | asset attribution amount for an   |
|                                   | attributable stakeholder. The     |
|                                   | market value of the asset at the  |
|                                   | time the gifting occurred would   |
|                                   | be used to assess the amount of   |
|                                   | gifting.                          |

|                                   | For example the sale of real      |
|                                   | estate to a family member or the  |
|                                   | sale of a business that did not   |

|                                   | If an attributable stakeholder    |
|                                   | disposes of the assets of a trust |
|                                   | or company and they do not        |
|                                   | receive adequate financial        |
|                                   | consideration for those assets,   |
|                                   | the deprivation rules apply based |
|                                   | on the attribution percentage of  |
|                                   | the attributable stakeholder.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | For example, Denise and Barbara   |
|                                   | are attributed with 50% each of   |
|                                   | the assets and income of a        |
|                                   | private company. They decide to   |
|                                   | sell an asset of the company to   |
|                                   | Denise's daughter. The asset is   |
|                                   | valued at $100,000, but they sell |
|                                   | it for $25,000. Deprivation       |
|                                   | applies for the difference        |
|                                   | between the market value and the  |
|                                   | sale value of the asset of        |
|                                   | $75,000. Their individual         |
|                                   | deprivation amounts are subject   |
|                                   | to their attribution percentages. |

|                                   | If the issue of more units or     |
|                                   | shares reduces the income or      |

|                                   | an attributable stakeholder who   |
|                                   | is a customer, and in turn        |
|                                   | reduces that customer's income or |

|                                   | gifting would need to be          |
|                                   | considered.                       |

|                                   | accepted, the customer must       |
|                                   | transfer/sell all their shares or |
|                                   | units. See                        |

|                                   | For example, if a partnered       |
|                                   | couple owed all 100 shares of the |
|                                   | company, and they attributed 100% |
|                                   | and the company then issues       |
|                                   | another 100 shares to a third     |
|                                   | party at a later date, the        |
|                                   | attribution would remain at 100%  |
|                                   | to the partnered couple.          |

|                                   | financial statements. The         |

|                                   | reflected in the entity tax       |
