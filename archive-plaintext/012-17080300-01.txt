This document outlines the process for assessing HCCS initial,
subsequent and S38 response applications.

HCCS applications

Eligible Medical Indemnity Insurers (MII) or Medical Defence
Organisations (MDO) must submit a HCCS application via the Medical
Indemnity Online Claiming (MIOC) system. In the event the MIOC system is
unavailable for a period of time (determined by the Director), a HCCS
application can be submitted with the relevant supporting documentation,
via post or email.

For more information on HCCS claiming see Medical Indemnity (MI) Schemes
Claiming.

The Resources page contains an overview of HCCS, links to the Services
Australia website and external websites about MI.
