This document outlines the authorisations, delegations and links to the
legislation for Child Support when Services Australia is notified of a
child of an assessment changing care from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2018 (3
March 2011 to 14 May 2019 for WA Ex-nuptial cases).

Change in care - Alignment of Legislation between Child Support and Centrelink

From 1 July 2010 (3 March 2011 for WA Ex-nuptial cases) customers who
have both a Child Support and Centrelink assessment and/or record are:

-   mutual customers, and
-   can notify either agency of a change to the care for a Family Tax
    Benefit (FTB) eligible/dependent child of an assessment

The Program who is notified first will:

-   record the change in care details
-   conduct investigations
-   make a care decision
-   give effect to the decision

Throughout this process, information will be shared between Child
Support and Centrelink electronically via data exchange. The final
decision will be applied electronically to the customer’s Child Support
and FTB assessment as the same rules are used to determine care
percentages.

Ex-nuptial cases), contact Blueprint to obtain previous versions of this

Amendments to the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989

The Child Support Assessment Act (the Act) was introduced on 1 October
1989, and has been amended on occasions since then.

From 23 May 2018, amendments were made to:

extend the interim period that applies for recently-established
court-ordered care arrangements, and

provide incentives for the person with increased care to take reasonable
action to participate in family dispute resolution where a care dispute
relates to:

-   an older court order
-   a parenting plan, or
-   a written agreement

From 1 July 2018, the Act was amended further, including changes to
‘care date of effect’ rules.

Both of the above amendments apply for WA Ex-nuptial case customers
where care changes are notified on or after 15 May 2019.

For changes in care notified from 1 July 2018 (15 May 2019 for WA
Ex-nuptial case children) see Notification of change in child support
care from 1 July 2018 (15 May 2019 for WA Ex-nuptial cases). Use this
document for changes notified before the changes taking effect or where
WA Ex-nuptial ‘Child Support Periods’ are present.

System Enhancements for WA Ex-nuptial cases

On 15 May 2019, WA parliament passed legislation that adopted all
Commonwealth child support laws not previously adopted. The parliament
also:

-   referred legislative powers in respect of the maintenance of
    Ex-nuptial children to the Commonwealth, and
-   repealed the Child Support (Adoption of Laws) Act 1990 (WA)

This means that all changes to care notified on or after 15 May 2019 are
managed under the same rules.

Services Australia enhanced the Child Support system on 18 June 2022 to
automatically treat WA Ex-nuptial customers correctly prospectively
where:

-   Child Support Periods (CSPs) are automatically raised on or after 18
    June 2022
-   New cases are registered or cases are restarted with a Start Date of
    Liability (SDOL) on or after 18 June 2022

As this enhancement was prospective only, workarounds are needed for
change of care notifications:

on or after 15 May 2019, and

‘date of events’ within Child Support Periods (CSPs) that reflect a WA
Ex-nuptial status of ‘Yes’ and:

-   care is notified outside of 28 days - late notified care change
-   disputed care - possible interim period - is notified
-   an amended tax assessment is lodged
-   a payee is entitled to child support under an agreement and the care
    they have of the child in the agreement falls below 35%

Service Officers should follow instructions within relevant Operational
Blueprint documents and macros for decision-making and customer
management where these circumstances are present. Once initial decisions
are made, affected records are identified via reporting and specialised
teams action to ensure legislatively correct implementation.

Authorisations and delegations

APS 3 or above

An APS 3 or above is authorised to:

-   determine a care percentage where a parent has had, or is likely to
    have, no pattern of care for a child (0% care) (s49)
-   determine a care percentage where a parent has had or is likely to
    have a pattern of care for a child (more than 0% care) (s50)
-   revoke an existing care percentage determination where a new care
    percentage determination under s49 or s50 would affect the cost
    percentage (s54F)
-   revoke an existing percentage care determination where a new care
    percentage determination under s49 or s50 does not affect the cost
    percentage but would affect the care percentage (s54H)

except where:

-   the care percentage is to be determined for a period where one
    parent unexpectedly gains 100% care of the child for a specific
    period (one-off block of 100% care)
-   determine a care percentage where the care percentage is worked out
    other than on the basis of the number of nights a child is in the
    care of a person during a care period (hours in care)

APS 4 or above

An APS 4 or above is authorised to:

-   make any of the decisions authorised at the APS 3 level
-   determine a care percentage for a period where a parent unexpectedly
    gains 100% care of the child for a specific period (one-off block of
    100% care)
-   make a decision that the care that is actually occurring for a child
    does not comply with an existing care arrangement that is in force
    for that child and the person who has reduced care of the child has
    taken reasonable action to ensure that the care arrangement is
    complied with (s51)
-   revoke an existing care determination where a person was previously
    determined under s50 to have at least regular care of a child and,
    despite the child being made available, the person has had no care
    or a pattern of care that is less than regular care (s54G)

Note: most revocation decisions where care falls below regular care will
actually be made under section s54F.

except where:

-   the care that is actually occurring for a child does not comply with
    an existing care arrangement that is in force for that child, and
    the parent who has reduced care of the child is seeking a new care
    arrangement that provides more care than the person is actually
    having but less than the care provided by the existing care
    arrangement, and special circumstances exist (s52)
-   determine a care percentage where the care percentage is worked out
    other than on the basis of the number of nights a child is in the
    care of a person during a care period (daytime care)

APS 5 or above

An APS 5 or above is authorised to:

-   make any of the decisions authorised at the APS 3 and APS 4 levels
-   make a decision that the care that is actually occurring for a child
    does not comply with an existing care arrangement that is in force
    for that child, and the person who has reduced care of the child is
    seeking a new care arrangement that provides more care than the
    person is actually having but less than the care provided by the
    existing care arrangement and special circumstances exist (s52)
-   determine an interim care period where the care period is between 14
    and 26 weeks (i.e. special circumstances apply) (s54C(4))
-   make a decision that a section 51 or 52 determination can be made
    despite the change of care day occurring more than 14 weeks ago, due
    to special circumstances. (i.e. extend the notification period up to
    26 weeks in special circumstances)
-   determine a care percentage where the care percentage is worked out
    other than on the basis of the number of nights a child is in the
    care of a person during a care period (hours in daytime care)

Note: sections 54F, 54G, and 54H apply only where a new determination of
a responsible person’s care percentage has been made under sections 49
and 50. The decision maker must be authorised under sections 49 and 50
to make a new care determination even where the authorisation to revoke
the existing care determination is at a lower level.

An officer at a lower level may still carry out the preliminary steps in
making care decisions with the support of their team leader, as long as
an officer with the appropriate level of authority makes the final
decision.

Support Services, Delegations and Authorisations.
