Requirement to claim foreign payment

As well as payments from agreement countries, Foreign Pension System
(FPS) screening for the requirement to claim a comparable foreign
payment (CFP) is applied to payments from the following non-agreement
countries:

-   the United Kingdom
-   Bosnia-Herzegovina
-   China
-   France
-   the Philippines, and
-   Sweden

The decision to screen for these particular countries is based on
migration patterns as well as the likelihood that a person who lodges a
claim will actually receive payment.

Unlike agreement countries, the requirement to claim from non-agreement
countries only applies to retirement based payments, not invalidity or
survivor based payments.

Assisting customers

While we do not have claim forms, Services Australia assists customers
to make a claim for a foreign payment and maintain their existing
foreign payment from non-agreement countries in the same way as for
payments from agreement countries.

As there are no social security agreements in place, we do not receive
notice of the result of claims and we are not able to request
information from or provide information to any of these countries.
Customers are required to notify us when they receive a notice of the
decision on their claim and, where necessary, must obtain any
information required directly from the foreign pension authority in the
relevant country.
