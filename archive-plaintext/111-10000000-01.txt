This document outlines digitisation which is used by Services Australia
to create electronic images of paper forms which are attached to a
customer's record. This includes customer and third party paper forms,
letters and other correspondence. The agency also receives digitised
information via Upload documents online and Desk Top Faxing.

Scanned documents

Digitisation of information allows scanned images of paper documents to
be accessible from a customer's record.

Unless exceptions apply, all correspondence should be digitised where it
is received, and on the date of receipt (or as close as possible to that
date).

Documents will classify at the point of scanning if:

-   a valid Customer Reference Number (CRN) is entered into the
    Multi-Function Device (MFD), and
-   a barcoded form or reclassification page is the first page scanned

If this does not occur, manual classification will be required. This
will delay the document attaching to the customer record.
