|                                   | Allison claims Family Tax Benefit |
|                                   | (FTB) for biological children,    |
|                                   | Simon (10), Alice (14) and Will   |
|                                   | (18). Allison is partnered.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Allison states that Simon and     |
|                                   | Alice are full time secondary     |
|                                   | students. Will is a full time     |
|                                   | student at a TAFE college         |
|                                   | studying towards Year 12 and is   |
|                                   | entitled to Youth Allowance (YA), |
|                                   | although this is paid directly to |
|                                   | Allison.                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Will is not an FTB child as       |
|                                   | Allison receives YA for Will.     |
|                                   | Will is entitled to receive YA    |
|                                   | because of being over the age of  |
|                                   | 18 even though Will is living at  |
|                                   | home. A quick check reveals that  |
|                                   | Will's YA rate is higher than the |
|                                   | FTB rate Allison would receive    |
|                                   | for Will (if the YA rate were     |
|                                   | lower, there is nothing           |
|                                   | preventing Will from stopping YA  |
|                                   | payments to be then treated as an |
|                                   | FTB child).                       |

|                                   | In this case, because the group   |
|                                   | home is taken to be legally       |
|                                   | responsible for the day-to-day    |

|                                   | the child, Mary would not be      |
|                                   | entitled to FTB for the children  |
|                                   | living in the group home.         |

|                                   | However, as the group home is an  |
|                                   | Approved Care Organisation, the   |
|                                   | group home may be eligible for    |
|                                   | FTB for the children.             |
