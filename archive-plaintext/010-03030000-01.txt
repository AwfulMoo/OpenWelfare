Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme. This Scheme provides assistance for
primary, secondary and certain tertiary students who are geographically
isolated from their nearest appropriate state school, have special needs
or are deemed isolated because of their circumstances.

Eligibility requirements for the applicant

The applicant must:

-   have primary care of the student
-   if an individual, satisfy residence requirements
-   not be receiving certain other Australian Government assistance
    (applicants may receive Family Tax Benefit (FTB) and assistance
    under the AIC Scheme for a student)

Eligibility requirements for the student

The student must:

permanently in Australia) or a permanent resident of Australia and live
in Australia during the school year

precludes AIC eligibility is where the student has been placed in

through a legal process, and their accommodation is financed wholly or
substantially by the state or territory government. An exception where
AIC may be paid is where the student is in the care of a
state-authorised foster parent

following:
