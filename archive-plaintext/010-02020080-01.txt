This document outlines the procedure when a customer lodges an ABSTUDY
additional information form (SY023).

When the form is required

Customers who have lodged an incomplete or incorrect claim for ABSTUDY
are required to complete and lodge an SY023, so that their claim can be
determined. A Service Officer may also determine to issue an SY023 to a
customer if the customer advises a major change to their circumstances
that may affect their rate of or eligibility for ABSTUDY.

Lodgement

ABSTUDY claims and forms may be lodged in person at the nearest service
centre, or in remote areas, with a Centrelink Field Officer. Claims and
forms may also be posted using the appropriate reply paid envelope to
the nearest ABSTUDY Smart Centre Processing Team site.

Processing

ABSTUDY processing has been consolidated across sites nationally.
Processing is now done in one of the ABSTUDY Smart Centre Processing
sites. See Processing arrangements for ABSTUDY claims and enquiries for
more information.

The Resources page contains a link to an SY023.
