| Example                           | Scenario                          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Customer's parent dies and the    |
|                                   | whereabouts of the other parent   |
|                                   | are unknown                       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The parent of a customer (who has |
|                                   | only ever lived with this parent) |
|                                   | dies. The other parent's          |
|                                   | whereabouts are unknown. This     |
|                                   | customer would not qualify as     |
|                                   | independent on the grounds of     |
|                                   | being an orphan because both      |
|                                   | parents are not dead. Assess this |
|                                   | customer under the Unreasonable   |
|                                   | to live at home criteria or the   |
|                                   | Parents are unable to exercise    |
|                                   | responsibilities criteria.        |

| 2                                 | Customer loses both parents and   |
|                                   | is cared for by a relative, not   |
|                                   | legally adopted                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Jane was orphaned at the age of   |
|                                   | 10 and lives with a relative. The |
|                                   | relative agrees to provide        |
|                                   | financial supports until Jane is  |
|                                   | financially independent. After    |
|                                   | turning 16, Jane applies for      |
|                                   | Youth Allowance. Jane is not      |
|                                   | subject to the Parental Means     |
|                                   | Tests due to being independent on |
|                                   | the grounds of being an orphan.   |
|                                   | The Parental Means Tests would    |
|                                   | only be applied to the relative   |
|                                   | if they had legally adopted Jane. |

| 3                                 | Customer holds a sub-class 117    |
|                                   | Orphan Relative visa              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A young person was born overseas  |
|                                   | and lost both parents in a        |
|                                   | conflict. Their relative raised   |
|                                   | them overseas until the relative  |
|                                   | arrived in Australia as a         |
|                                   | refugee. The relative then        |
|                                   | sponsored the young person’s      |
|                                   | migration to Australia (without   |
|                                   | an Assurance of Support) and the  |
|                                   | young person was issued a 117     |
|                                   | Orphan Relative visa, in June     |
|                                   | 2017. This young person is        |
|                                   | subject to the NARWP.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, in this example,         |
|                                   | consider an exemption to the      |
|                                   | NARWP as the young person was a   |
|                                   | 'family member' of a refugee or   |
|                                   | former refugee, when the refugee  |
|                                   | arrived in Australia and is       |
|                                   | currently a family member of that |
|                                   | person at the date of claim.      |
|                                   | Refer case to Centrelink          |
