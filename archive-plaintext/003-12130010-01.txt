If you have concerns about a child’s safety, conduct the risk and
referral process.

For Services Australia social workers only

This document outlines the different categories and fields used by
Services Australia social workers to record referrals in the Social Work
Information System (SWIS).

Definition of referral

A referral is when a customer is referred to a social worker for a
particular reason or combination of reasons, for example:

-   a delegated assessment
-   help with accommodation
-   a family and domestic violence incident
-   issues relating to caring for a friend or relative

Referral contact required

For every referral there must be at least 1 contact recorded, and in
many cases there are multiple contacts for each referral. For more
information on contacts, see Recording contacts in the Social Work
Information System (SWIS).

Restrictions on referral issues

Social workers are restricted to recording a maximum of 3 referral
issues per referral. If more than 3 issues are identified, only the 3
most significant issues should be recorded, and a second referral must
not be recorded to note the additional issues. There is currently no
provision to prioritise the referral issues, but this is under
consideration for future SWIS Releases.

The Resources page contains a link to the updated SWIS Help text.
