|                                   | Guidelines. The job seeker should |
|                                   | be referred to their provider to  |
|                                   | discuss their participation and   |

|                                   | or part-time study or training,   |
|                                   | including a short course. This is |
|                                   | important because it may impact   |
|                                   | on the level of servicing the     |
|                                   | provider can offer. If the        |
|                                   | provider approves the short       |
|                                   | course, they will code the course |
|                                   | details in the Department of      |

|                                   | system. However, if the customer  |
|                                   | is enrolled in a course of study  |
|                                   | that would make them eligible for |
|                                   | a student payment, then this      |
|                                   | should be discussed with the      |
|                                   | customer and where necessary a    |
|                                   | transfer to another more          |

|                                   | However, the provider's decision  |
|                                   | of whether a job seeker can have  |
|                                   | their full-time study approved or |
|                                   | not, does not determine their     |

|                                   | -   the job seeker is not willing |
