Financial hardship capacity formula

Only use the Financial hardship – capacity calculator within the
Financial hardship macro when:

-   a financial hardship application is being considered, and
-   the customer’s necessary expenses indicate a need to reduce the rate
    of ongoing debt repayment

This table describes the components of the financial hardship capacity
formula.
