This document outlines the requirements for coding Fares Allowance (FAA)
for Pensioner Education Supplement (PES).

Requirement to lodge a claim

A customer receiving Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) must lodge a
Claim for Fares Allowance (SY005) to enable them to be paid FAA.

Authorising travel in advance

Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) customers can also request their
travel be authorised in advance and Services Australia will book
qualifying students travel prior to the journey occurring.

Claim assessment

The details of the journey for both pre-booked travel and customers
seeking reimbursement for travel already undertaken are required to be
recorded on the customer's record. Once the customer has lodged their
claim form, a Service Officer will assess their eligibility and record
the claim on the computer system. A letter will then be sent to the
customer advising of the outcome of their claim for FAA.
