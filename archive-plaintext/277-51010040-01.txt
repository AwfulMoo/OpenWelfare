This document outlines the action to be taken by Centrelink staff when
Child Support rejects a customer's child support application.

On this Page:

Following up a rejected child support application

When Child Support rejects an application, they advise the customer of
the decision and also advise Centrelink so that child support action can
be followed up.

Service Officers should:

-   ensure information on the customer's record is correct
-   check that an application for child support assessment is needed
-   contact the customer to advise what action the customer needs to
    take to satisfy the Maintenance Action Test (MAT)

Reasons for child support application rejection

The most common reasons for rejecting a child support application are:

-   the paying parent was not proven nor presumed to be parent of the
    claimed child
-   the paying parent was not a resident of Australia for tax purposes
    on the day of the application
-   the receiving parent was not an eligible carer on the day of the
    application, for example the child was not in their care, or they
    had less than 35% care
-   both parents were still in a genuine domestic relationship with each
    other on the day of the application
-   the child has completed year 12 or equivalent or is not in full-time
    study, or the child is a full-time secondary student aged over 18
    years and an application to extend the child support assessment has
    not been lodged

No evidence of parentage

If customer does not know the identity of the other parent, they may
need to be referred to a social worker to seek a parentage unknown (PNK)
exemption. See Exemptions from seeking child support for Family Tax
Benefit (FTB) customers.

If the customer has named the parent but cannot obtain evidence, the
customer should be referred to legal advice to discuss their options. A
check should be made whether the paying parent is in a reciprocating
country and proof of parentage does not exist.

The Resources page contains a link to the Services Australia website and
text to include in letters to customers to advise the requirement to
take child support action after Child Support has rejected the child
support application.
