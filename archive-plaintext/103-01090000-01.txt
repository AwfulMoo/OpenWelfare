This document outlines the Work Items that apply to all measures of
Income Management and the BasicsCard. Work Items and messages are
created on a customer's record when an activity is actioned that
requires further investigation or a review is required.

Work Items and messages

If the system or a Service Officer initiates an Assessment Result (AR)
process on an income managed customer, or a potential Income Management
customer, and if further action is required, one of the following will
display the:

-   Income Management Summary screen if in workflow, or
-   Income Management Warning and Error (IMWE) screen, if coding
    manually

The screens may display a message or Work Item that could impact Income
Management. All appropriate discussions and updates must be completed
whilst the customer is present to address the Work Item generated.

The Resources page contains links to the Technical Support Line, the
BasicsCard homepage and a link to the Services Australia website.
