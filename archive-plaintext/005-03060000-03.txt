|                                   | An AoS debt cannot be waived due  |
|                                   | to administrative error as s1237A |
|                                   | of the Social Security Act 1991   |
|                                   | only applies where the payment is |
|                                   | received by the debtor (assurer). |
|                                   | An assurer does not receive the   |
|                                   | payment so s1237A does not apply. |
|                                   | For instance, where an assuree    |
|                                   | had received an incorrect rate of |
|                                   | recoverable payment, due to an    |
|                                   | administrative error. Although    |
|                                   | the error was administrative, the |
|                                   | payment was made to the assuree   |
|                                   | rather than the debtor. As such,  |
|                                   | the debt cannot be waived due to  |
|                                   | administrative error as the       |
|                                   | assuree is not the debtor in the  |
|                                   | AoS case                          |

|                                   | The only grounds to waive an AoS  |
|                                   | debt is special circumstances     |
|                                   | under SSAct section 1337AAD. The  |
|                                   | special circumstances may apply   |
|                                   | to the assurer and/or the         |
|                                   | assuree.                          |

|                                   | SSAct section 137AAE strengthens  |
|                                   | debt recovery provisions by       |

|                                   | -   if the assurer/s claim they   |
|                                   |     were unaware of the           |

|                                   |     AoS. This is because the      |
|                                   |     potential assurer must attend |
|                                   |     an interview with Services    |

|                                   |     explained to them. They must  |
|                                   |     then confirm that they        |
|                                   |     understand these AoS          |

|                                   | needs waiving and an amount has   |
|                                   | been recovered, return the amount |
|                                   | to the assurer. This means, if    |
|                                   | the bank guarantee was used to    |
|                                   | recover all or part of the debt,  |
