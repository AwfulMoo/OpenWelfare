This document outlines information about employer withholding and an
election for EW not to apply.

Deductible liabilities must be, as far as practical, collected by
deductions from a person’s salary or wages. This includes amounts due
payable for:

-   enforceable maintenance liabilities (ongoing periodic liability)
-   child support debts
-   child support related debts, and
-   carer debts

A payer with an ongoing periodic liability can ask us not to deduct
payments from their pay. Child Support can accept this election if
satisfied that payments will be made on time. Generally, an election
cannot be accepted if the person has a debt, unless the payer was
unaware of the debt or has established an extended period of voluntary
compliance addressing the debt.

An election cannot be made when there is no ongoing periodic liability
payable, and deductions are only to repay a debt.

EW and Parental Leave Pay (PPL)

When an employer elects to administer these payments to eligible
customers, the payments will be subject to the same rules as for EW. If
the person does not wish to have payments deducted from PLP they must
make an election for EW not to apply.
Note: references to an election for EW not to apply include an election
for PLP deductions not to apply.
