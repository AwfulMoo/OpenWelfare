This document outlines information about employer withholding and an
election for Employer Withholding (EW) not to apply.

Registered maintenance liabilities are required to be collected by
deductions from the payer's wage or salary. The Registrar can accept a
payer's election for EW not to apply if satisfied all future payments
will be made on time. Some contractors are also subject to these
provisions.

EW and Parental Leave Pay (PPL)

When an employer elects to administer these payments to eligible
customers, the payments will be subject to the same rules as for EW. If
the payer does not wish to have payments deducted from PLP they must
make an election for EW not to apply.
Note: references to an election for EW not to apply include an election
for PLP deductions not to apply.

The Resources page contains links to a document to assist Service
Officers when processing an election for EW not to apply and to the
Application to stop child support deductions from salary or wages form
(CS1652).
