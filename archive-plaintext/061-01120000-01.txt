This document outlines information about significant changes to the
Australian Working Life Residence (AWLR) laws governing the rate of
Centrelink payments paid outside Australia from 1 July 2014. These
changes apply to customers paid under either domestic or international
agreement portability assessments.

On this Page:

Customers who are 'saved' (grandfathered) under the pre 1 July 2014 rules

Special 'savings' provisions apply to customers who were either:

-   Outside Australia immediately before 1 July 2014. This special
    provision will continue to apply as long as the person remains
    outside Australia, unless they return to Australia for a period of
    26 weeks or more, or
-   Inside Australia temporarily. Customers who normally reside outside
    of Australia and were in Australia temporarily when the rules
    changed. This special provision will continue to apply as long as
    the person leaves Australia on or before 29 December 2014, unless
    they return to Australia for a period of 26 weeks or more

These customers are able to continue to receive payment under the same
conditions that they were subject to on their last departure before 1
July 2014.

Returning to Australia and impact on saved status

A customer who is covered by this 'savings' provision can return to
Australia for a visit and then return overseas an unlimited number of
times without losing their 'savings' provision as long as they do not
remain in Australia for 26 weeks or more in a single visit.

In other words, if a customer covered by this 'savings' provision
returns to Australia for 26 weeks or more on or after 1 July 2014, they
will lose their 'savings' provision. If they then decide to return
overseas, they will be subject to the portability rules that apply at
the time.

It is important that customers currently covered by this 'savings'
provision contact Centrelink International Services (CIS) if they plan
to return to Australia. CIS will ensure the customer is given accurate
information about the possible effect on their payment if they decide to
return.

This 'savings' provision is also applicable to many customers paid under
an international agreement as the portability rate provisions for these
customers have also changed.

Additional savings provision for customers receiving a Comparison Rate

An additional 'savings' provision also applies for customers receiving a
Comparison Rate under an international agreement who were inside
Australia on 1 July 2014.These customers are able to continue to receive
payment under the same conditions that they were subject to immediately
before 1 July 2014.

These customers will cease to receive the benefit of this 'savings'
provision if they:

-   leave Australia, or
-   move to an 'inside Australia' (direct deduction) rate, or
-   move to an autonomous assessment, or
-   cease to be entitled to payment

Payment types eligible for the pre 1 July 2014 savings provisions

The savings provisions may apply to all customers receiving the
following payments:

-   Age Pension
-   Disability Support Pension (DSP)
-   Parenting Payment Single (PPS)
-   Carer Payment (CP)
-   Bereavement Allowance (BVA)

Note: Wife Pension (WP) and Widow B Pension (WidB) customers who
transferred to Age Pension on 20 March 2020 retained their savings
provisions.

The savings provisions can only be utilised by customers payable outside
Australia indefinitely under either domestic or international agreement
assessment except for the New Zealand Agreement. All other payments have
limited portability under existing portability legislation.

Under the existing portability rules there were a number of exemptions
from being paid a proportional rate of pension. Most of these exemptions
were removed with the change in law in September 2000 (for example, an
Age Pension customer granted before 2 July 1986) however, customer's
protections under the 20 September 2000 provisions will continue to
apply.

Portability rate rules

Customers who are payable outside Australia indefinitely, are usually
paid at a proportional rate after 26 weeks absence from Australia,
although some international agreement may apply proportionality at a
different point in time. Residence in Australia between 16 years and Age
Pension age is used to determine a person's Working Life Residence
(WLR). Note: customers receiving Age Pension, DSP and CP travelling to
New Zealand are paid under special rules using their working age
residence. These special rules remain unchanged from 1 July 2014.

Customers who departed Australia before 1 July 2014, or are 'saved' from
the 1 July 2014 AWLR changes can generally continue to receive the
maximum means tested rate of pension if they have 300 months (25 years)
or more AWLR.

From 1 July 2014, the maximum means tested rate of payment will require
a person to have 420 months (35 years) or more AWLR with the following
exceptions.

If the customer is paid using the Agreement with Greece the maximum WLR
is:

-   300 months (25 years) for customers who were Australian residents at
    the commencement of the Agreement, or
-   528 months (44 years) for customers who were not Australian
    residents at the commencement of the Agreement

If the customer is paid using the Agreement with the Republic of North
Macedonia, the maximum WLR is:

-   420 months (35 years) for customer who were Australian residents at
    the commencement of the Agreement, (300 months (25 years) if 'saved'
    under the 1 July 2014 portability provisions), or
-   528 months (44 years) for customers who were not Australian
    residents at the commencement of the Agreement

Payment specific rules

From 1 July 2014, customers paid Age Pension or DSP under an
international agreement will cease to be able to use their partner's
AWLR, unless 'saved' from the 1 July 2014 portability rate changes.

Customers in receipt of CP or WP under an international agreement prior
to 1 July 2014 are able to commence using their own AWLR from that date,
if favourable to do so. Customers granted or who transfer to a payment
under an international agreement after this date will use their own
AWLR, unless 'saved' from the 1 July 2014 AWLR changes.

From 1 July 2014, customers granted or who transfer to a payment under
an international agreement as a widowed person (PPS, WidB or BVA) will
continue to be paid a rate using their deceased partner's AWLR.

Letter to be issued

Any customer returning to Australia must have a 'Client has returned/is
returning from overseas. Call in to office' (XOB005) letter issued. This
letter has an option available to ensure that Centrelink correctly
advises of any disadvantage (loss of 'saved' status) caused by the
customer remaining in Australia for more than 26 weeks.

Age Pension or DSP customer saved under 1/7/2014 savings provisions returned to Australia temporarily – unable to depart

Age Pension or Disability Support Pension (DSP) customers saved under
the 1 July 2014 savings provisions, who reside overseas, but are
temporarily in Australia and unable to travel due to unforeseen
circumstances, may be considered for an extension to retain their
savings provisions after 26 weeks.

If a customer would like to be assessed for a portability extension,
refer them to Centrelink International Services.
