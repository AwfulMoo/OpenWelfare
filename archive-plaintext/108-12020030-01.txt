This document outlines the procedure to assist Service Officers to code
a manual rate of payment for an ABSTUDY customer.

Manual rate of ABSTUDY

Generally, the system is able to automatically calculate the correct
rate for a customer to be paid. In some cases this does not occur and
the rate may need to be manually entered into the system for the correct
rate of payment to occur.

When a manual rate is coded, care needs to be taken to adjust rates as
required after any reassessments.
