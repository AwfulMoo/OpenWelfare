This document outlines what action to take when Pension Bonus Scheme
(PBS) annual reminder letters are returned to Centrelink.

Annual reminder letters

PBS annual reminder letters are sent every year to remind members that
they are still registered in the PBS and to encourage them to request an
Evidentiary Certificate. PBS annual reminder letters also mention the
lodgement time for claiming the Pension Bonus, the work test, and the
possible entitlement to a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC).

Members registered for PBS have no notification requirements. The PBS
annual reminder letters encourage them to advise of any change of
address.

Correspondence returned from member's address

If mail is returned from the address currently shown on the member’s
record, their whereabouts will be considered unknown ('whereabouts
unknown' (WUK)). The agency’s scanning provider will scan the barcoded
letter to their record. If the person is in receipt of a Services
Australia payment and their address is the same as on the letter, their
payment will be automatically suspended ‘WUK’. If the address details
are different or the member is not in receipt of a Services Australia
payment a DOCument will be registered on their record for follow up
action. Automatic 'SUS'pension or 'CAN'cellation can occur only if the
recipients are not identified as vulnerable or as requiring exception
processing.
