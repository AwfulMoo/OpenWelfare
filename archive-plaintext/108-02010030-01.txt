This document outlines the application of the Parental Income Test (PIT)
for Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme.

Parental Income Test

The Parental Income Test is used to calculate entitlement to Additional
Boarding Allowance (ABA). ABA is the only AIC Scheme allowance that is
means tested.

Note: from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2018 a Maintenance Income Test
also applied. For historical information on how the Maintenance Income
Test applied, see Maintenance Income Test (MIT) for ABSTUDY and Youth
Allowance (YA).

Families eligible for Basic Boarding Allowance for a student can also be
paid ABA if the student's annual boarding charges exceed the maximum
rate of Basic Boarding Allowance less $250 for incidentals, and either:

-   at least one of the student's parents qualifies for a PIT exemption,
    or
-   combined parental income for the appropriate tax year does not
    exceed the PIT Upper Income Limit for AIC

For the PIT Upper Income Limit for AIC, see Assistance for Isolated
Children (AIC) - Parental Income Test (PIT).

Income applied

The PIT applies to the AIC applicant and their partner (if they have a
partner).

If the student's parents are separated or divorced, determine who the
approved applicant is and apply the PIT to that parent (and their new
partner, if applicable).

PIT exemption

The PIT will not apply for an AIC ABA student during the period where
the applicant or their partner:

receives a certain social security benefit or pension or a payment paid
by the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA), listed in Module L of
Section 1067G of the Social Security Act 1991 (for example, Service
Pension, Income Support Supplement (ISS), Veteran Payment)

receives ABSTUDY Living Allowance

receives Farm Household Allowance (FHA)

The applicant or their partner are not taken to be receiving an income
support payment, and an exemption from the PIT will not apply if they:

-   are serving an Income Maintenance Period that reduces their rate to
    nil
-   are in an employment income nil rate period, or
-   have an AGE/CZR PLS status (indicating receipt of Home Equity Access
    Scheme payments only)

the student is in a State authorised care arrangement and their carer
does not receive a foster care allowance or similar assistance for them

In these cases, the parental income test is not applied to either
person’s income and, subject to boarding costs, the student is entitled
to the maximum Additional Boarding Allowance during the period.

Note: an additional exemption only applies to an AIC ABA student if the
applicant or their partner holds a current Health Care Card or has a
Health Care Card because they receive the maximum rate of Family Tax
Benefit Part A. An exemption from the PIT will not apply:

-   after the expiry date on the card
-   where the applicant or their partner holds a Low Income Health Care
    Card (also known as a Low Income Card)
-   where the applicant or their partner holds a Health Care Card
    because they receive a social security Mobility Allowance or Carer
    Allowance (for a disabled child), or
-   where the applicant or their partner holds only a Pensioner
    Concession Card or a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card

PIT application

Any parental income above the Parental Income Free Area (PIFA) (see
Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) - Parental Income Test (PIT) is
divided among the children within the family pool. The share of the
parental income for each child will depend on the maximum amount of the
payments for which that particular child is eligible.

A sibling is included in the family pool if they are in receipt of:

-   Youth Allowance
-   ABSTUDY Living Allowance
-   ABSTUDY Group 2 School Fees Allowance (means tested component), or
-   AIC Additional Boarding Allowance (ABA), or
-   A sibling who meets the definition of an FTB child or regular care
    child and aged 0 - 15 or 16-19 and in full-time secondary study is
    also to be included in the family pool

All of the following payments will be included in the family pool where
there is only one dependent young person in the family and they also
receive more than one of the following payments:

-   ABSTUDY Living Allowance
-   Group 2 School Fees Allowance – means tested component
-   Assistance for Isolated Children Additional Boarding Allowance, or
-   Meet the definition Family Tax Benefit (FTB) child or regular care
    child

For example, where a child receives AIC ABA and meets the definition of
a Family Tax Benefit (FTB) child or regular care child simultaneously,
both amounts will be included in the family pool calculation.

The family taper of 20% is then applied to the child's share of the
parental income above the threshold. This means that the rate of payment
is reduced by the child’s share of 20 cents for each dollar of their
parents' affecting income.

Child, and Regular Care Child.
