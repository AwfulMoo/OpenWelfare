How reconciliation overpayments occur

Reconciliation overpayments can be caused by more than 1 reason. These
can include:

-   income changes
-   changes in relationship status which can cause changes in income
-   child support/maintenance issues
-   changes to shared care or blended family percentages
-   child did not satisfy study requirements
-   child's income was over the child income limit (for the 2013-14
    financial year and earlier years)
-   child left the customer's care
-   incorrect details used to assess an FTB lump sum claim
-   assessment of an FTB immunisation grace period

Reasons for CCB overpayments

This list is not exhaustive and can include:

-   income changes
-   incorrect schooling percentage used to assess the rate
-   JET Child Care fee assistance (JETCCFA) is not included in CCB
    reconciliation

When a customer contacts about a reconciliation overpayment, the Service
Officer should check that the customer's circumstances for the relevant
financial year match the details on the customer's record. Based on the
possible reasons given above, Service Officers need to ask appropriate
questions about the family's circumstances to work out why the
overpayment occurred.

The Resources page contains a link to MyIT and information regarding a
shared care system problem (P24845) that occurs when a parent has
transferred their Family Tax Benefit (FTB) to their current partner
(step parent).
