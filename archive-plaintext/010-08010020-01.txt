This document outlines how the Partner Income Test applies to students
and Australian Apprentices claiming or receiving ABSTUDY under 22 years
old, Austudy and Youth Allowance where their partner is not receiving a
social security pension.

Income Test

ABSTUDY, Austudy and Youth Allowance (YA) students and Australian
Apprentices are subject to a Personal Income Test on any ordinary income
they receive. Depending on their circumstances, they may also be subject
to a Partner Income Test and Parental Income Test.

Income Bank

Students/Australian Apprentices can access a Student Income Bank or the
Australian Apprentice Income Bank. This enables them to build up credits
while they are not being paid ordinary income, for use when they do get
paid ordinary income.

Note: the Income Bank only applies to the customer's personal income.
Partner income is not reduced by the Income Bank balance.

There are separate rules for Partner Income Test for ABSTUDY customers
22 years and over.

Unfavourable decisions

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them a chance to provide more information, and
-   advise their review and appeal rights

The Resources page contains examples of applying the Partner Income Test
and calculating the Partner Income Free Area (PIFA).
