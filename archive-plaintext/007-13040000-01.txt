(MFU) generated as a result of Families claims or activities.

Actioning Manual Follow Ups (MFU)

It is important that MFUs are actioned in accordance with correct
processes. The action required to be taken will vary depending on the
type of MFU.

An MFU can be created manually by a Service Officer or generated
automatically as a Transfer Action Generator (TAG) MFU when an action or
reassessment is undertaken on a record.
