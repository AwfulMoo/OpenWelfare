What is a BasicsCard

The BasicsCard is an allocation method for income managed funds, to
allow a customer to meet their and their family's priority needs.

BasicsCard has been suspended

A customer or payment nominee can contact to reactivate a suspended
BasicsCard.

A BasicsCard may be suspended using the reason 'other'. This must only
be used when the reasons lost, stolen or damaged are not applicable.

BasicsCard blocked due to incorrect PIN

If a customer enters their Personal Identification Number (PIN)
incorrectly six times at a BasicsCard Merchant, the BasicsCard PIN will
be 'blocked' by the Card Transaction Provider (CTP).

If a customer's/payment nominee has a BasicsCard that is 'blocked', the
card will remain 'blocked' until the customer contacts. These
BasicsCards can be 'unblocked' by the customer changing or resetting
their PIN.

BasicsCard has been closed

If a BasicsCard has been 'Closed', it is not able to be reactivated and
customer/payment nominee will need to attend a face-to-face interview to
obtain a replacement BasicsCard.

Interface, the BasicsCard Contingency Support System, the BasicsCard
