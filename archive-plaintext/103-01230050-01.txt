What is a BasicsCard?

The BasicsCard is an allocation method for income managed funds, to
allow a customer to meet their and their family's priority needs.

BasicsCard has been suspended

A customer or payment nominee can contact to reactivate a suspended
BasicsCard.

BasicsCard posted in the mail

Customers/nominees who have requested a BasicsCard be posted in the mail
need to activate the card and set a PIN before they can use it. Once the
customer/nominee receives the BasicsCard in the mail, they will need to
contact Services Australia for support with these actions.

Note: A BasicsCard will be suspended using the reason 'other' when it
has been posted in the mail.

BasicsCard blocked due to incorrect PIN

If a customer enters their Personal Identification Number (PIN)
incorrectly six times at a BasicsCard Merchant, the BasicsCard will be
'blocked' by the Card Transaction Provider (CTP).

The card will remain 'blocked' until the customer/payment nominee
contacts. These BasicsCards can be 'unblocked' by the customer/payment
nominee changing or resetting their PIN.

BasicsCard has been closed

If a BasicsCard has been 'Closed', it is not able to be reactivated and
customer/payment nominee will need to obtain a replacement BasicsCard.

The Resources page contains a link to the BasicsCard Alternative
Interface, the BasicsCard Contingency Support System, the BasicsCard
intranet page and contact details for the policy helpdesk.
