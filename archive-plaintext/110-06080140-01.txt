For staff processing Service Updates or Host System Reviews.

This document outlines the procedure for manually adding a debt to a
finalised Service Update or Host Review from in the IRS.

Debts triggered by Service Update or Host Review

In some circumstances a debt which is triggered by the Service Update or
Host Review is required to be manually attributed to a Service Update or
Host Review in IRS. This can occur when:

-   the debt is manually created after the Service Update or Host Review
    has been finalised, or
-   the debt is manually created during the review period but is not
    correctly identified as a debt related to the Service Update or Host
    Review

Manually attributing debts

Generally there is no updating of any Service Update or Host Review
information from within IRS, however Review Officers (ROs) may manually
attribute a debt to the Service Update or Host Review from within IRS
if:

-   the debt is not attributed to any other Service Update or Review
-   the debt is not an excluded debt
-   the debt was created after the start of the Service Update or Host
    Review and
-   within 56 days from the date the Service Update or Host Review was
    finalised, and
-   the action to manually attribute the debt occurs within 56 days from
    the finalisation of the Service Update or Host Review

Estimating or raising debts

The debt can be estimated or raised to be manually attributed to a
Service Update or Host Review in IRS. For estimated debts, the debt will
be reported once it is raised.

A review processed in IRS, such as Compliance or Fraud Reviews cannot
manually add a debt to a finalised review. For these reviews the debt
must be raised before the review is finalised.

The Resources page contains a list of Debt Reasons which are excluded
from being attributed to any Service Update or Review.
