This document outlines the process to correct a complex error that has
been identified. Errors include decisions that have not yet been made or
processed.

Complex error criteria

An error is considered complex if:

-   it occurred more than 6 months ago
-   it has a rate impact on a period of the assessment that is greater
    than 6 months liability. Rate impact relates to the assessment not
    the collection status.
-   the customer has a duplicate customer record
-   the case has ended (including the reverse case if applicable)
-   a mixed assessment is in place or is required
-   a workaround is required which involves recording a formula
    modification
-   the case involves a non-parent carer with 2 or more associated cases
-   external remedies are not available for example, Change of
    Assessment (COA) is not available as the error occurred more than 7
    years ago
-   error correction will create an overpayment
-   the correction results in a role reversal (back dating 3 months or
    more)
-   the error needs a mySupport form completed to correct the issue
-   child support period alignment is required for more than the current
    Last relevant year of income (LRYI)
-   a decision is recommended to not correct the error
-   a decision is recommended to partially correct the error by applying
    the correction from a date later than the error's date of effect
-   a decision is recommended to be considered invalid
-   a Change of Assessment decision is recommended to be reviewed and
    altered
-   a Departure Prohibition Order decision is recommended to be reviewed
    and altered

Invalid decisions

New Customer and Mainstream Services Program Support Managers (PSM) are
authorised to make certain parentage decisions invalid where an
application for assessment has been accepted or refused in error due to
the decision maker:

-   failing to take account of material evidence such as a birth
    certificate that was already in agency possession
-   denying a customer procedural fairness by making a decision before
    the expiration of a policy stated time frame
-   failing to explore all nine fact situations that could have
    satisfied the presumption of parentage provisions
-   denying a customer procedural fairness by not consulting them before
    making the decision
-   making a keying error that resulted in the decision being
    incorrectly refused

All staff in the Child Support Program Advice team are also authorised
to make these decisions. The decision to declare a decision invalid in
other circumstances can only be authorised by an Assistant Director in
