This document outlines information and steps to follow when record
locking and transaction locking occurs in in Process Direct.

Record locking

Record locking is different in Process Direct than other systems. In:

Customer First or Customer Record - record locking stops more than one
Service Officer updating the same record at the same time

Process Direct - if another Service Officer is in a customer’s record a
Record Access Warning Message with the user log on ID will appear at the
top left hand side of the screen

-   this is only a warning message, Service Officers can still view and
    update the customer record
-   this allows multiple users (such as Service Officers, the system via
    automation, or the customer through online services) to access and
    update a record at the same time

Transaction locking

In Process Direct, a Service Officer is not able to update or assess the
same transaction another Service Officer is currently processing. The
transaction will be locked by the first Service Officer, this is called
transaction locking.

If a Service Officer accesses a locked transaction:

-   A Transaction Error Message with the user log on ID will appear at
    the top left hand side of the screen
-   The rest of the record can still be accessed and viewed
-   The transaction cannot be updated or finalised. Functions like
    Assess, Add, Edit and Delete will be disabled

Unlocking a transaction

In urgent circumstances, a transaction lock can be removed via the
Transaction Unlocking screen.

Urgent circumstances may include:

-   The system incorrectly displays that a Service Officer is in the
    transaction
-   Customer disclosing that they are in imminent risk, or critically
    ill

Reasonable attempts must be made to contact the Service Officer or their
Team Leader for the transaction to be exited before the transaction is
manually unlocked.
