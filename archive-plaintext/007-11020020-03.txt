|                                   | received $100 CCB, however they   |

|                                   | work/training/study test or have  |
|                                   | an exception for a period where   |
|                                   | $100 was the Child Care Fees and  |
|                                   | $20 CCB entitlement.              |

|                                   | were $400 and the CCB was $80     |
|                                   | (that is, excluding the amount    |
|                                   | for the periods they did not meet |
|                                   | the work/training/study test or   |
