|                                   | the stillbirth, Sarah was able to |

|                                   | weeks of the date that Sarah was  |

|                                   | Karen's estimate meets the        |

|                                   | test and is considered            |
|                                   | reasonable. Karen is granted SBP  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Although Karen is receiving FTB   |
|                                   | Part A for Luke and Emily, this   |
|                                   | eligibility to FTB Part A is not  |
|                                   | used to determine her eligibility |

|                                   | because Karen meets the Stillborn |

|                                   | Mary gives birth to a stillborn   |
|                                   | child, Kate on 1 January 2020 and |
|                                   | lodges a claim for SBP while      |
|                                   | still living overseas.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As Mary is not currently residing |
|                                   | in Australia and has been         |
|                                   | overseas for an extended period   |
|                                   | at the time of claim, Mary does   |
|                                   | not meet Australian residence     |
|                                   | requirements within 26 weeks of   |
|                                   | delivery of the stillbirth, and   |
|                                   | is therefore not eligible for     |
|                                   | SBP.                              |

|                                   | The family returns to Australia   |
|                                   | on 1 August 2020 and Mary lodges  |
|                                   | a claim for FTB instalments for   |
|                                   | Ben. Her claim for FTB is         |
|                                   | granted. A Manual Follow-up (MFU) |
|                                   | is generated to follow-up Mary’s  |
|                                   | entitlement to SBP. This allows   |
|                                   | the original claim for SBP to be  |
|                                   | reassessed without the need for   |
|                                   | Mary to lodge a new claim.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Mary is paid SBP for Kate. This   |
|                                   | is because Mary became eligible   |
|                                   | for FTB Part A within 52 weeks of |
|                                   | the delivery of the stillborn     |
|                                   | child.                            |

|                                   | still not eligible for FTB Part   |
|                                   | A. This is because they are       |

|                                   | as their permanent visa’s were    |

|                                   | for FTB within 26 weeks of        |
|                                   | Anton’s delivery (except for the  |
