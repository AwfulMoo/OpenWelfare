|                                   | This is the period in the         |
|                                   | financial year that the customer  |
|                                   | (or their current partner) is     |
|                                   | entitled to child support from a  |

|                                   | include any period when the       |
|                                   | customer is not entitled to       |

|                                   | For example, if a couple          |
|                                   | separates part way through the    |
|                                   | financial year, the relevant      |
|                                   | period would not include the      |

|                                   | voluntary child support is        |
|                                   | received and ends when the last   |

|                                   | Generally, the relevant period    |
|                                   | starts from the beginning of the  |
|                                   | financial year or the date the    |
|                                   | child support entitlement         |
|                                   | commences, whichever is later.    |

|                                   | For example, if a Child Support   |
|                                   | entitlement continued from the    |
|                                   | previous financial year, the      |
|                                   | relevant period would start from  |
|                                   | 1 July. If a Child Support        |
|                                   | assessment or Court Order started |
|                                   | from 1 February, this would be    |
|                                   | the start of a customer's         |
|                                   | relevant period.                  |

|                                   | If an initial Child Support       |
|                                   | assessment is backdated, the      |
|                                   | start day of the assessment is    |
|                                   | used to work out the customer's   |
|                                   | relevant period. Voluntary        |
|                                   | maintenance received before       |

|                                   | commences, but only if in the     |
|                                   | intervening period the customer   |
|                                   | remains entitled to child support |
|                                   | for example, they did not         |
|                                   | reconcile or child did not leave  |
|                                   | care.                             |

|                                   | If voluntary maintenance is       |
|                                   | received in a year where no child |
|                                   | support liability exists, the     |
|                                   | relevant period starts when the   |
|                                   | voluntary maintenance is received |
|                                   | and ends when the last payment is |
