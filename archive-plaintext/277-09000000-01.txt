Government intent

The child support scheme was formed to assist separated parents to take
responsibility for the financial support of their children. The Child
Support Registrar administers the child support scheme that was
introduced by government in 1988.

On 1 July 2011, Services Australia began delivering the services and
payments provided previously by the Child Support Agency, Medicare
Australia, Centrelink and the then Family Assistance Office. Child
Support is now a service delivery brand within the agency.

The child support scheme involves the assessment of child support in
accordance with a formula as well as the collection and enforcement of
court orders, child support agreements and child support assessments.
