Penalties for Payment Nominees

Payment Nominees:

-   face monetary penalties if they fail to produce proper records of
    how they managed the customer's payment
-   must keep a record of the expenditure of the customer's payments,
    and
-   these records can be requested at any time for review purposes

If a review is conducted, the nominee:

-   will receive a notice requesting a statement regarding the disposal
    of money paid under Social Security Law, to the Nominee on behalf of
    the recipient
-   must comply with this request, and
-   if they fail to do so, monetary penalty provisions apply

These penalty provisions only impact Payment Nominees under 123L(6) of
the Social Security (Administrative Act) 1999.
