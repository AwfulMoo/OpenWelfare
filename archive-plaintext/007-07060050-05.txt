Manual rate calculation of FTB Part A

This table describes the example used to manually calculate a reduced
FTB Part A.

For more examples, see References page for a link to the Family
Assistance Guide, 3.1.3, Apportioning Income Test Reductions between FTB
Part A Rate Components.

Scenario

Member of a couple with 2 children aged 3 and 8, adjusted taxable income
of $56,500, annual maintenance income of $2,450 (1 person receives child
support for the 2 children), paying rent of $225 per week. The FTB
parent is grandfathered for Energy Supplement. Both children meet
immunisation requirements.

Note: the FTB Part A supplement is only payable after the end of the
financial year and is not included in these calculations. Rates used in
this example apply for the 2019-20 financial year.

These amounts may not be current. They are examples only. For current
payments, see Rates and thresholds.
