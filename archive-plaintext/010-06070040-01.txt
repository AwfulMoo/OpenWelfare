This document outlines how to assess concessional study loads to
determine eligibility for YA.

Concessional study load

A concessional study load for YA is a reduced study load requirement of
two-thirds (66%) of the normal full-time study load for a course.

This two-thirds concessional study load allows a customer to satisfy the
activity test and still qualify for benefits as a YA student (including
the student income bank and higher income free area for earnings).

Concessional study load and activity test

YA customers who reduce their study load to less than 75% but equal to
or more than 66% of the normal amount of full-time study may be able to
meet the activity test as a secondary or tertiary concessional study
load student, if the reduction in study load is for a specific reason as
outlined below.

Reason for concessional study load

Secondary or tertiary students seeking YA under the two-thirds
concessional study load rule, must be studying the reduced study load
temporarily because of 1 of the following reasons:

-   The education provider's normal requirements for the course (for
    example, there are timetable clashes, a subject has been cancelled
    or over-enrolled or a subject is unavailable in that semester)
-   A specific direction in writing from the academic registrar or
    equivalent officer
-   A recommendation, in writing from the academic registrar or
    equivalent officer, for academic or vocational reasons, regardless
    of whether the reason is given with the recommendation or not. This
    reason may only be applied for the maximum of half an academic year

Collecting two-thirds concessional study load information from students

There are a number of ways a student may notify the agency of their
concessional study load. This includes via the:

-   online claim
-   Manage Study Details online service
-   Manage Study Details service via Express Plus Centrelink mobile app
-   Study Details (MOD ST) form
-   proof of enrolment, or
-   an academic transcript

Students who are completing a claim online, or managing their study
details online, will be asked about the structure of their enrolment.
This includes if it is full-time or part-time.

When Service Officers are assessing claims, online study updates, or
other study related information provided by customers, they should
consider if a two-thirds concessional study load applies to that
student.

Customers who become incapacitated

If a customer has reduced their study load due to becoming
incapacitated, see Youth Allowance (YA) Student or Australian Apprentice
becomes incapacitated.

Customers with a disability or caring responsibilities

The 25% study load concession (that is a concession for students
undertaking at least 25% of the normal amount of full-time study) does
not apply to YA students, however activity test requirements may be
adjusted for YA job seekers with a disability or with carer
responsibilities who are under 22 years of age. Customers with a
disability or who have caring responsibilities may also test their
eligibility for other income support payment including Disability
Support Pension or Carer Payment.

Youth Disability Supplement (YDS) is paid to full-time students and
Australian Apprentices in receipt of YA if the customer is under 22
years of age and has been assessed through an Employment Services
Assessment (ESAt) as having a partial capacity to work of less than 30
hours per week.

Unfavourable decision

When making an unfavourable decision, speak to the customer:

-   explain the decision
-   give them a chance to provide more information, and
-   advise their review and appeal rights
