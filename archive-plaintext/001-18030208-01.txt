This document outlines the policy and procedures about making a decision
when a job seeker commits a mutual obligation failure.

Mutual obligation failures

Compulsory requirements are designed to ensure that job seekers,
including ParentsNext participants, receiving a participation payment
are actively looking for work and/or participating in activities that
will help them into employment.

A mutual obligation failure is committed when a job seeker or
ParentsNext participant who is receiving a participation payment fails
to:

-   enter into a Job/Participation Plan
-   meet their monthly points target (for Workforce Australia
    participants only)
-   attend, or be punctual for a compulsory appointment
-   participate in a compulsory activity
-   undertake adequate job search efforts or meet other job search
    related requirements included in their Job/Participation Plan (for
    Workforce Australia, job search is included in their monthly points
    target requirement)
-   undertake any other activities outlined in their Job/Participation
    Plan
-   act in an appropriate manner during an appointment or while
    participating in a compulsory activity
-   attend a job interview, or behaves inappropriately at an interview
-   act on a job opportunity when requested to do so by their employment
    services provider, or if they intentionally act in a manner and it
    is reasonably foreseeable that acting in that manner could result in
    an offer of employment not being made to that person
-   record that they have complied with a compulsory requirement (for
    job seekers with digital literacy limitations, this will need to be
    done in collaboration with their Provider)

Note: a mutual obligation failure may be committed for failing to comply
with a compulsory requirement scheduled on a weekend.

Consequences of a mutual obligation failure

When a job seeker fails to comply with their participation requirements
their payment may be suspended until they contact their provider to
discuss the failure.

Payment will be suspended immediately if:

-   the job seeker is a Community Development Program (CDP) job seeker -
    these job seekers are subject to the Job Seeker Compliance Framework
    (JSCF)
-   the job seeker is in the penalty zone under the Targeted Compliance
    Framework (TCF), or
-   the failure is a work refusal or unemployment failure

Payment will not be suspended immediately if:

-   the job seeker is in the green or warning zone under the TCF, and
-   the failure is a mutual obligation failure

When a job seeker in the TCF green or warning zone fails to meet a
mutual obligation requirement, the Department of Education, Skills and
Employments system (DESE ESSweb) system will send them a notice by SMS
or email. This notice tells the job seeker:

-   it appears they have missed a requirement, and
-   they must contact their provider to avoid having their payment
    suspended

Job seekers who receive this message must, within 2 business days:

-   contact their provider to re-engage and/or
-   satisfy their provider they have a valid reason for missing their
    requirement

Their payment will remain suspended until they contact their provider
and meet any re-engagement requirements the provider sets.

If a job seeker contacts Services Australia about this message, they
must be told to contact their provider as soon as possible to avoid
payment suspension.

Note: Services Australia staff will not be able to see these messages on
the job seeker's record. ESSweb will only trigger the suspension if the
job seeker has not contacted their provider and re-engaged within two
business days.

Provider responsibilities

Providers have responsibility for monitoring compliance with compulsory
requirements and have delegation for some decisions under Social
Security Law. Their responsibilities include:

-   identifying and recording that an incident has occurred that
    constitutes a mutual obligation failure
-   identifying and electronically advising Services Australia using the
    Employment Services System (ESSweb) of a mutual obligation failure
    so that payment can be suspended
-   identifying and recording if a valid reason does or does not exist
    for a mutual obligation failure for the purpose of confirming or
    removing a demerit
-   Notifying job seekers of the reconnection requirements for mutual
    obligation failures
-   electronically notifying Services Australia the deemed date of
    notification for reconnection requirements and when conditions have
    been met for suspension to be ended
-   using a Non-Compliance Report (NCR) to notify Services Australia
    that a mutual obligation failure requires assessment of whether a
    reasonable excuse exists for the purpose of determining whether a
    penalty should be applied

Services Australia decision maker responsibilities

Participation Solution Team (PST)-skilled Service Officers who have a
WNPPD IT security resource determine whether to apply a failure for:

-   persistently committed mutual obligation failures by a job seeker in
    the TCF penalty zone, or
-   work refusal failures and unemployment failures

PST-skilled Service Officers are responsible for:

-   delivering key messages about the expectation that job seekers take
    personal responsibility to actively participate and remain engaged
    with their provider
-   conducting a compliance investigation for a non-compliance event
    that has been reported, recording the relevant facts along with any
    supporting evidence in the Participation Compliance workflow
-   determining whether the job seeker had a reasonable excuse for
    failing to comply with a compulsory requirement (where applicable)
-   reviewing and updating the job seeker's Circumstances Impacting
    Compliance, particularly where there has been a change to the
    severity of frequency of a circumstance's impact on a job seeker's
    ability to meet their mutual obligation requirements
-   applying failures that result in financial penalties or
    non-compliance cancellations where reasonable excuse is not
    established
-   determining start and end dates of post-cancellation non-payment
    periods
-   advising the job seeker of the outcome of decisions made by Services
    Australia, the consequences of these decisions, and their review and
    appeal rights

Consultation with a PST Senior Service Officer (SSO), PST-skilled social
worker or other specialist officer may be appropriate when assessing the
impact of job seeker circumstances on their capacity to comply. See
Accessing a PST-skilled social worker for information on when
consultation with a PST-skilled social worker may be appropriate.

Job seekers transitioning between job seeker compliance systems

Job seekers will transition between job seeker compliance systems where
they change residential address and either commence in or cease to
participate in the Community Development Program (CDP).

Where job seeker transfers to a CDP provider:

-   outstanding mutual obligation failures may still be investigated and
    a financial penalty applied
-   any non-compliance cancellation due to a mutual obligation failure
    or post-cancellation non-payment period will remain in place

The Resources page contains a link to a decision maker resource for
mutual obligation failures and contact details for the Department of
Education, Skills and Employment.
