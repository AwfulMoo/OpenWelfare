This document outlines the process to calculate the start date of a
claim, when the customer has lodged their claim after their partner has
died.

Overview

If a person makes a claim for a Social Security payment and the person
is qualified for the payment on the day on which the claim is made, the
person's start day in relation to the payment is the day on which the
claim is made. However, in some circumstances, a person's start day may
be earlier and different rules apply to different circumstances.

If the customer is qualified for payment, and the claim was made within
4 weeks of the partner's death, the start day for payment is the first
day the customer is qualified on or on the day after their partner died,
whichever is later.

This backdating provision applies to all social security payments.

Note: where the claim is made more than 4 weeks after the partner's
death, these backdating provisions do not apply. The start day for these
customers would be the date of claim unless other backdating provisions
apply.

Exclusion periods

The start day of a claim will be delayed if the customer is required to
serve a waiting, preclusion, or non-payment period for a time in gaol or
a psychiatric institution (for committing an offence). All these waiting
and non-payment periods are referred to as Exclusion Periods.

The Resources page contains examples of the calculation of the start day
when a claim is made soon after the death of the customer's partner.
