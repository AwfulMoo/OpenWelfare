This document outlines the process for the non-pursuit of individual
child support debts.

Non-pursuit of debt

Child Support must pursue recovery of debt owed, unless the debt is:

-   uneconomical to pursue
-   not legally recoverable

A non-pursuit of debt (NPOD) must only be made if all appropriate
collection action has been exhausted and there is no possibility the
debt can be collected. During NPOD, the debt is still owed to the
Commonwealth but proactive recovery action is being deferred, as it is
not viable/possible to collect the debt at this time.

A decision not to pursue a debt can be made for individuals and
employers.

The majority of non-pursuit debts are reviewed later to determine if
collection action can occur.

NPOD does not apply to overpayments. The overpayment debt will remain on
the customer’s record.

Note: NPOD was previously known as Write-Off. Although some Cuba screens
reflect the words Debt Write Off or Written Off, the current and correct
term to use is 'non-pursuit of debt'.
