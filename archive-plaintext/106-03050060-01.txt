This document outlines how to book an interpreter for a future
appointment for customers who have limited English proficiency.

Interpreting services during COVID-19

Services Australia introduced changes to interpreting services during
the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. These services continue to be
available for customers with limited English proficiency:

Interpreter Connect service (on-demand telephone interpreting): connects
staff immediately to a telephone interpreter via an automated system

Booked telephone appointments: staff can book a telephone interpreter
for future appointments

Booked on-site appointments: only available by exception, for example
Auslan and sign language appointments

Rostered interpreter service (sessional):

-   provides staff with rostered on-site interpreters at service centres
    with high language needs. Restrictions to the service are dependent
    on the service centre’s COVID status level
-   Indigenous rostered interpreters are available at Broome, Kununurra
    and Halls Creek Service Centres

Booked interpreters

Booked interpreters are for

-   future on-site and telephone appointments, and
-   appointments of 30 minutes or more

On-site interpreters are the preferred option when appointments are
complex, lengthy or relate to sensitive information.

If an on-site interpreter is not available, a booked telephone
interpreter is appropriate when the appointment is less than 30 minutes,
in a remote area, or for a rare language.
