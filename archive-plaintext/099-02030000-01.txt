Standard Bereavement Template

The 'Standard Bereavement Template' is used for initial advices sent to
the surviving partner, carer or family after Services Australia has been
notified of (and has verified) the death of a customer.

Three attachments are incorporated into the template:

-   Needing help after someone has died?
-   Checklist of people and organisations you may need to contact

These attachments include information on grieving. Government and
non-Government organisations providing support following a death, and a
checklist of who may need to be notified of the death.

The attachments will be printed automatically with each letter but
cannot be viewed in the Centrelink system.

The Resources page contains links to letter template attachments,
bereavement letter changes, and information about bereavement
assistance.
