This document outlines how the personal and partner income tests apply
to customers who are claiming or receiving Youth Allowance (YA) as a
student, Austudy or ABSTUDY, including the application of the income
bank. Customers receiving these payments are not entitled to Working
Credit as they have access to the income bank.

Income Test

Youth Allowance (YA), Austudy and ABSTUDY customers are subject to a
Personal Income Test on any income they receive. Depending on their
circumstances, they may also be subject to a Partner Income Test or the
Parental Means Test.

Students and Australian Apprentices are able to access income banks
which enable them to build up credits while they are not earning income,
for use when they do earn income.

Transfers between payments attracting Working Credits

If the customer transfers to a payment that attracts Working Credits
with the exception of Youth Allowance (other), they will be able to
transfer the lower of their income bank balance or 1000 credits from
their income bank to their new Working Credit balance. If the customer
transfers to Youth Allowance (other) they will be able to transfer the
lower of their income bank balance or 3500 credits to their new Working
Credit balance.

Youth Disability Supplement (YDS) is paid to full-time students and
Australian Apprentices in receipt of YA and ABSTUDY if the customer is
21 years of age and under and has been assessed by an Employment
Services Assessment (ESAt) as having a partial capacity to work of less
than 30 hours per week.
