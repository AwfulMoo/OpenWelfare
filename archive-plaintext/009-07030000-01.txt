This document outlines information about the annual Child Disability
Assistance Payment (CDAP) available for carers of children with a
disability, which is payable in addition to the payment of Carer
Allowance (CA) for the child.

Annual CDAP

CDAP helps carers with the costs of caring for a child with a disability
or medical condition. CDAP is an annual payment made in July of up to
$1000 for carers who receive CA (child).

Carer Allowance (CA) Health Care Card (HCC)

Carers in receipt of a CA Health Care Card (HCC) only on 1 July are not
entitled to CDAP

Note: Customers receiving CA HCC only still have a status of CDA/CUR.

Eligible customers

Families with children who qualify their parent/carer for payment of CA
on 1 July of the current year will receive the payment.

The following carers will be eligible for Child Disability Assistance
Payment (CDAP):

-   Carers receiving CA (child) for a period which includes 1 July will
    be eligible for the annual payment including carers retrospectively
    granted for a date on or before 1 July, and carers retrospectively
    cancelled with a date of effect after 1 July
-   Carers who receive a CA lump sum bereavement payment for a period
    that covers 1 July
-   Carers with at least one child qualifying for CA (auto) on 1 July

Note: Health Care Card only CA recipients are not eligible for the
annual payment for carers.

An individual can receive more than one CDAP annual payment for children
in their care. It is paid per CA payment for each child, such as, a
carer providing care for two children and receiving two payments of CA
will receive two annual CDAP payments.

Note: if payment of CA is granted after January and backdated to a date
that includes July 1. The CDAP will not be automatically generated and
must be paid manually.
