| Item                              | Description                       |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Written Down Value (WDV) + Read   |
|                                   | more ...                          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | This amount is the original cost  |
|                                   | of an asset less the total        |
|                                   | depreciation claimed to date. The |
|                                   | term 'Opening WDV' is the written |
|                                   | down value of the item at the     |
|                                   | beginning of the period covered   |
|                                   | by the depreciation schedule. The |
|                                   | term 'Closing WDV' is the written |
|                                   | down value of the item at the end |
|                                   | of the period covered by the      |
|                                   | depreciation schedule, that is,   |
|                                   | takes into account depreciation   |
|                                   | claimed against the assets during |
|                                   | the current period. The term      |
|                                   | often used for WDV is 'book       |
|                                   | value'.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The WDV of an asset can usually   |
|                                   | be used for Assets Test purposes  |
|                                   | but valuations may be necessary   |
|                                   | for buildings, or when the        |
|                                   | current value is clearly higher   |
|                                   | than the WDV. A licenced valuer   |
|                                   | for Services Australia can value  |
|                                   | assets like buildings or plant    |
|                                   | and equipment. A copy of the      |
|                                   | depreciation schedule should be   |
|                                   | provided to them if a valuation   |
|                                   | is required.                      |

|                                   | Depreciation cannot be claimed as |
|                                   | an expense when the asset is      |
|                                   | being used for private purposes.  |
|                                   | Consequently, the depreciation    |
|                                   | schedule allows for the entity to |
|                                   | specify a percentage of the time  |
|                                   | during which the asset was used   |
|                                   | for private purposes.             |

|                                   | depreciation is only claimed for  |
|                                   | that part of the year during      |
|                                   | which the asset was owned.        |

|                                   | This refers to any items          |

|                                   | This is also referred to as a     |
|                                   | balancing charge. If the amount   |
|                                   | received for an asset upon its    |
|                                   | disposal is greater or lesser     |
|                                   | than it's written down value      |
|                                   | (WDV), the excess is included in  |
|                                   | assessable income for both tax    |
|                                   | and Social Security purposes.     |
|                                   | However, this income can be       |
|                                   | reduced or eliminated by          |
|                                   | offsetting it against the         |
|                                   | depreciation to be claimed for    |
|                                   | other depreciable assets on the   |
|                                   | profit and loss statement. If the |
|                                   | amount received on disposal is    |
|                                   | less than the WDV of the asset    |
|                                   | the difference is an allowable    |
|                                   | deduction that year for both tax  |
|                                   | and Social Security purposes.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As with all one off income or     |
|                                   | expenses, the profit or loss on   |
|                                   | sale can be disregarded           |
|                                   | altogether if it is a one off and |
|                                   | unlikely to be repeated, but that |
|                                   | would only occur in exceptional   |

|                                   | Depreciation allowed by the       |
|                                   | Australian Taxation Office (ATO)  |
|                                   | is allowed as a deduction against |
|                                   | rental income for Social Security |
|                                   | Income Test purposes. The ATO     |
|                                   | allows depreciation of fixtures   |
|                                   | and fittings of a building or     |
|                                   | structure utilised to generate    |
|                                   | rental income under subsection    |
|                                   | 54(1) of the Income Tax           |
|                                   | Assessment Act (ITAA) 1936 and    |
|                                   | Division 42 (section 15) of the   |
|                                   | ITAA 1997. Fixtures and fittings  |
|                                   | include items such as furniture,  |
|                                   | light fittings, carpets, blinds,  |
|                                   | kitchen oven, hot water system,   |
|                                   | heaters, air conditioners and     |
|                                   | above ground pools. Depreciation  |
|                                   | is not allowed by the ATO on      |
|                                   | electrical wiring, plumbing and   |
|                                   | gas fittings, sinks, tubs and     |
|                                   | baths, garages, fences or         |
|                                   | in-ground pools.                  |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The ATO has produced schedules of |
|                                   | depreciation for items of         |
|                                   | equipment and these or any other  |
|                                   | equitable method of calculating   |
|                                   | depreciation will be accepted. If |
|                                   | doubt exists the section of the   |
|                                   | ITAA under which the depreciation |
|                                   | was claimed should be             |
|                                   | ascertained.                      |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Depreciation is not allowed by    |
|                                   | the ATO in respect of the actual  |
|                                   | building or structure utilised to |
|                                   | generate rental income. Although  |
|                                   | it is common for a depreciation   |
|                                   | schedule provided in respect of a |
|                                   | rental property to claim          |
|                                   | depreciation on construction      |
|                                   | costs, this is not depreciation,  |
|                                   | but a write-off of these costs.   |
|                                   | This write-off expense can        |
|                                   | usually be readily identified as  |
|                                   | such by the percentage rate       |
|                                   | claimed in the depreciation       |
|                                   | schedule, usually 2.5% or 4%.     |
|                                   | This expense is not allowed as a  |
|                                   | deduction for Social Security     |
|                                   | Income Test purposes.             |
|                                   | Accordingly, if a depreciation    |
|                                   | schedule indicates that the       |
|                                   | expense claimed includes          |
|                                   | depreciation on construction      |
|                                   | costs, the amount claimed should  |
|                                   | be added back to the net rental   |
|                                   | profit.                           |
