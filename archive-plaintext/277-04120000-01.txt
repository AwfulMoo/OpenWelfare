This document outlines the debt repayment methodology and provides clear
expectations for negotiating repayment of debt. All customer service
staff in all business areas must use it.

Debt repayment rationale

The methodology ‘Collection is everyone’s responsibility’:

-   applies to both payers and payees with debt
-   provides an objective and fair approach to the repayment of debt
-   aligns with the child support formula and the principal object of
    Child Support, that is, to ensure children receive financial support
    from their parents based on their capacity
-   compares to industry standards for debt repayment. For example,
    lending institutions and other child support agencies
    internationally
-   provides a simple and consistent framework for staff and customers
-   includes a standardised assessment of capacity for repaying debt,
    and
-   takes individual circumstances into account

The Customer Management Approach (CMA) for Child Support explains which
areas complete more than Minimum Collection Activity and when it is
appropriate to refer to another area for collection action. The debt
repayment methodology must be used in all situations.

Debt repayment hierarchy

The aim of the debt repayment hierarchy is to achieve repayment of debt
in the shortest possible time. To achieve this, the debt repayment
methodology uses a hierarchy, which helps to maximise collection
outcomes from parents with debt:

-   Payment in full - Immediate recovery of debt through a one-off lump
    sum payment
-   Three instalments - Recovery of debt within 3 instalments, or a lump
    sum plus up to 3 instalments
-   Ongoing payment arrangement - Ongoing repayment amount, based on a
    standardised capacity formula
-   Hardship - Ongoing repayment amount, based on an individual
    assessment of financial hardship

The Resources page contains information about the capacity formula for
domestic and international cases, frequently asked questions about debt
repayment, letters issued when a payment arrangement is processed, the
automated message and links to calculators, macros and the National
Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) and National Redress Scheme external
websites.
