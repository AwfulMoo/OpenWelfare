|                                   | on the Express Authority. It is   |
|                                   | important to use the word 'today' |
|                                   | when providing this information.  |
|                                   | For example, 'I can confirm the   |
|                                   | customer does/does not have a     |

|                                   | If a tax agent asks questions     |
|                                   | that are outside the Express      |
|                                   | Authority, advise the tax agent   |
|                                   | 'No authority exists to give you  |
|                                   | that information'.                |

|                                   | Note: staff must not tell a       |
|                                   | customer or tax agent whether a   |
|                                   | tax refund will be garnished.     |
|                                   | This is extremely important as    |
|                                   | tax garnishee decisions cannot be |
|                                   | made in advance. Staff cannot     |
|                                   | predict reconciliation tax refund |
|                                   | offsetting which can be confused  |
|                                   | with a tax garnishee.             |
