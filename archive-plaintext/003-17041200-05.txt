|                                   |     This evidence may be          |
|                                   |     sufficient for the purposes   |
|                                   |     of an assessment              |
|                                   | -   If a claimant has provided    |

|                                   |     Coordination Branch could     |
|                                   |     undertake a specialist        |
|                                   |     assessment in some instances, |
|                                   |     this may only provide         |
|                                   |     evidence regarding current    |
|                                   |     symptoms and impacts of the   |
|                                   |     event. In some AVTOP cases,   |
|                                   |     the impacts from a previous   |
|                                   |     period may have resolved over |
|                                   |     time. In these instances it   |
|                                   |     is critical to have access to |
|                                   |     evidence in relation to the   |
|                                   |     previous impacts rather than  |
|                                   |     just current functioning      |
