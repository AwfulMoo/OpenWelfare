This document outlines assistance in dealing with the edits which occur
and may prevent or delay the finalisation of an Inter-environment Change
of Address (ICoA) activity. Edits indicate that there are situations
which are preventing an ICoA transfer. Edits may be encountered by the
user during the starting or scheduling of an ICoA or when monitoring a
transfer.

Geographically based environments

The Centrelink computer system divides Australia into a series of
geographically based environments. When a customer changes their address
from one environment to another, their computer file record must also be
transferred. The Inter-environment Change of Address (ICoA) facility is
used to transfer records between environments.

Delay or prevention of transfer

As the ICoA facility requires action in two environments, there are
various factors which can delay or prevent the transfer being finalised.
This requires regular monitoring of the transfers to ensure all
appropriate action is taken and finalised and that cases with problems
are referred to mySupport. See Inter-environment Change of Address
(ICoA) facility problem escalation process.

Customer requests review officer bypass

It should be noted that an Inter-environment transfer fails, with error
code 'EO761T, Appeals Incomplete ODM Reconsideration exists', where the
review officer reconsideration is bypassed at the customer's request. In
this case, see Inter-environment change of address (ICoA) transfer of a
customer record.
