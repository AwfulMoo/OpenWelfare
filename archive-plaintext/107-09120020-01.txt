This document outlines the procedures to follow when raising Fares
Allowance (FAA) debts.

Fares Allowance (FAA) payability

FAA is payable to eligible students in receipt of:

-   ABSTUDY
-   Austudy
-   Department of Social Services (DSS) Pensioner Education Supplement
    (PES), or
-   Youth Allowance (YA)

They must live away from their permanent home in Australia to study. FAA
is a payment for travel between the customer's permanent home and their
education institution. The number of payments of FAA to which they are
entitled depends on the type of basic payment they receive.

Debts and charges for FAA

Raise a debt for FAA when:

-   it is determined that a customer was overpaid FAA, or
-   a penalty has been charged for a 'no show'

The Resources page contains a link to the Instrument of Financial
Delegation, examples of events that may cause a customer to incur a debt
of FAA and a table of responsible payees for ABSTUDY purposes for FAA.
