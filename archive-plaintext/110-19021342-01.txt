This document outlines how Compliance Officers (CO) assess and finalise
an AoIS intervention.

Manual Integrated Review System (IRS) processing

A manual assessment is only needed when an Automation of Income Stream
intervention cannot be progressed in Process Direct. This occurs when:

-   the debt amount has not calculated correctly, or
-   the customer is deceased

Assess and finalise intervention

Finalise the income stream assessment and decide the overpayment amount
using either:

-   Debt Explanation Tool (ADEX), or
-   MultiCal debt calculation

If the update results in a debt this must be fully explained to the
customer. Tell the customer what information was used to calculate the
outcome, for example, verification received from the customer or third
party (provider). The customer must be given the opportunity to provide
more details before the outcome is finalised.

If the customer does not contact in response to the Pre-Adverse decision
letter or fails to give more information the outcome will be finalised.

When updates are completed and applicable debts raised, all actions must
be documented and the Automation of Income Stream intervention
finalised.
