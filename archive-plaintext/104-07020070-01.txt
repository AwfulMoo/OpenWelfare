This document outlines the process Managers and Team Leaders in Services
Australia are to follow when conducting post incident contact after an
incident of customer aggression and counterproductive behaviour.

Post incident contact

Contacting the customer after an incident of customer aggression or
counterproductive behaviour helps keep staff safe.

Post incident contact allows Services Australia to:

-   understand what happened from the customer's perspective
-   reinforce Services Australia's expectations of respectful behaviour
-   help assess the future risk to staff and customer safety
-   understand, follow-up and resolve the trigger for the incident
    including providing referrals
-   provide a warning which can be a verbal warning or a warning letter
-   discuss the implementation of a Managed Service Plan (MSP) where
    applicable

Post incident contact should be undertaken by the Line Manager/Team
Leader of the person who experienced the incident of customer aggression
to discuss the incident and potential consequences of their behaviour.

Where the staff member who experienced the incident is a Team Leader or
Manager, the impact of the incident on them must be considered. If they
do not feel confident making the contact, they should ask a colleague,
or a supervisor, not directly involved to make contact. When post
incident contact includes notifying a customer of the implementation of
an MSP this should be conducted by the one main contact. If required,
seek advice from the local Customer Aggression Network Operational
Contact or the Customer Aggression Prevention Team (CAPT).

Factors to consider before making customer contact

Where a customer poses an ongoing risk to staff safety, a Managed
Service Plan (MSP) must be implemented. For more information about MSP
referrals and proposals across business areas, see Customer aggression -
Managed Service Plan (MSP).

The details of the incident will inform the timing of post incident
contact. The following should be considered:

-   Where a provisional MSP is implemented due to the risk to the safety
    of staff and property, the decision may be to contact the customer
    immediately. This allows Services Australia the opportunity to
    notify the customer of the limits to their contact options before
    the customer attempts further contact
-   The effects of aggression can affect the customer’s capacity to
    process information after an incident. Judgement should be used in
    deciding when to make contact with the customer, and it may be
    appropriate to contact them a day after the incident
-   Approved decision makers should consider the effectiveness of
    sending a warning or MSP SMS to the customer if it is determined the
    compact delivery of a key message is warranted prior to sending the
    relevant warning or MSP letter

If required, seek advice from the local Customer Aggression Network
Operational Contact or the Customer Aggression Prevention Team (CAPT).

Documenting contact (including unsuccessful attempts)

Contact attempts must be documented in the approved agency system:

-   Centrelink: Customer Incident Management System (CIMS)
-   Child Support: Customer Incident Recording Tool (CIRT)
-   Medicare: Customer Incident Recording Tool (CIRT)

Where a decision is made not to contact a customer, this must also be
documented.
