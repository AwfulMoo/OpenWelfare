|                                   | payment from 1 July. If a person  |
|                                   | cares for 2 people and receives   |
|                                   | CP and 2 CA payments, they would  |
|                                   | qualify for 3 payments of CS.     |

|                                   | their first regular CA payment    |
|                                   | from 1 July. For example, if a    |
|                                   | customer receives 50% of CA       |
|                                   | because they share the payment    |
|                                   | with another carer they will      |
|                                   | receive 50% of the CS.            |

|                                   | The carers are paid a total of    |
|                                   | $1,200 with their first regular   |
|                                   | CP and CA payment from 1 July     |
|                                   | with the second regular payment   |
|                                   | from 1 July. For example, CA paid |
|                                   | before CP then CS paid with CP.   |

|                                   | grant or review for 1 July, will  |
|                                   | be eligible for the payment.      |

|                                   | For example, a carer contacts the |
|                                   | agency about claiming CP and CA   |
|                                   | (child) caring for one child on   |

|                                   | The carer lodges the claim on 29  |
|                                   | June. The claim is assessed and   |
|                                   | the carer is granted on 1 August  |
|                                   | with a start day of 25 June. The  |
|                                   | carer is eligible to receive CS   |
|                                   | in respect of CP and CS in        |
|                                   | respect of CA ($1,200), or one    |
|                                   | component of CS for each payment. |
