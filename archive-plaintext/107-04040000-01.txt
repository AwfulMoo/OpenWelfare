This document explains the process for staff in Centrelink International
Services (CIS) to determine code and raise a debt, when a customer or
their partner is granted a lump sum that represents arrears of a foreign
pension.

Arrears debts

When a customer or their partner is granted a Comparable Foreign Payment
(CFP), on most occasions they are granted with a backdated start date,
which means the person, receives a lump sum payment that represents
arrears for a past period. In some cases, for example, rate revision,
foreign pension authorities may backdate increases in the rate of a
foreign pension and pay a lump sum arrears payment.

Note: arrears debts that may exist because of small back-payment of
regular increases (Consumer Price Index (CPI)) in foreign pensions are
too small to be recovered and investigation is not cost effective.

If the customer's Australian payment would have been reduced had they
received regular payments during the arrears period instead of a lump
sum, a recoverable arrears debt may exist, however, before considering
any arrears debt, it is important to first code the ongoing income from
the correct date of event, see Foreign Pension coding.

Before 1 July 2004, arrears debts could only exist if the CFP was
covered by an international social security agreement and then only
applied to the customer, not their partner. Since 1 July 2004, under
section 1228A of the Social Security Act 1991, a debt may exist for both
the customer and their partner for lump sum arrears of a CFP from any
country.

Pension Bonus Scheme (PBS) payments are not affected by lump sum arrears
payments of foreign pensions.

Deceased customers

If the person who is entitled to the CFP is deceased at the time the
overpayment is calculated, no arrears debt exists for them or their
partner.

If the partner of a person who is entitled to the CFP is deceased at the
time the overpayment is calculated, an arrears debt only exists for the
person who is entitled to the CFP and not the deceased partner, even if
the partner was alive for any part of the arrears period

Coding arrears periods

After coding the ongoing rate of the CFP, arrears periods for backdated
grants are also recorded on the Foreign Pension Details (FPD) screen. As
CFP arrears lump sums are received at a point in time, to reflect the
relative value of the amount received, policy advice is that the
exchange rate used must be the rate that was applicable at the time the
lump sum was received.

If available, the arrears period and lump sum amount received may be
coded on FPD. System processing will apply the relevant exchange rate
from the Date of Event coded and divide by the arrears period to derive
a consistent rate of foreign pension to be applied throughout the
arrears period.

If a country provides the rates of foreign pension applicable during the
arrears period, the rates may be manually converted and coded from the
Arrears Period Start Date (APSD) in Australian dollars at the exchange
rate applicable at the time the lump sum was received. In some cases,
the rate of foreign pension may be coded as zero from the Arrears Period
End Date (AESD).

Note: arrears or rate increases for foreign survivors' pensions must
only be coded from the Bereavement Period End Date (BPED). If the
arrears start date advised is before the BPED, the rates of the survivor
pension must be manually converted to Australian dollars and coded
between the BPED and the arrears end date.

Arrears lump sums are treated in the same way as ongoing pensions, for
example income, direct deduction. When coding lump sum arrears amounts,
the system will assess independently of notification rules as they are
assessed under s1228A Social Security Act 1991. Foreign pension rate
revisions that include arrears can also be coded on FPD even if the new
arrears period overlaps other arrears and will assess any adjustment
independently.

However, where coding the rates of foreign pensions during the arrears
periods, the system will apply the date of effect rules which may affect
the overpayment calculation. These cases must be checked manually to
ensure the system calculated amount is correct.

Recovery and New Zealand embargo

Arrears debts may be recovered by any normal debt recovery methods
available under the Social Security Act 1991. This does not apply to
arrears debts under the Italian Agreement before 1 July 2004.

Some agreements provide for one country to withhold amounts from any
lump sum arrears associated with the grant of pensions and send them to
the other country to recover a debt that arises because of the arrears
amount. This is referred to as an embargo.

For practical reasons, embargoes on foreign pension arrears are only
applied under the Agreement with New Zealand. The NZ Agreement uses a
direct embargo model which means whatever arrears are payable are sent
to the other country. Requests for embargo from NZ pension arrears are
sent on the agreed liaison form with the NZ pension claim.

Note: only arrears from NZ claims can be embargoed. Arrears debts for
backdated NZ pension increases cannot be recovered by embargo.
