This document outlines information on processes to be followed upon the
death of an income support customer or their partner and the bereavement
assistance that may be payable.

Notifying a death

When Services Australia is notified of a death, the information
collected will be used and shared with Centrelink, Child Support and
Medicare records. However, additional contact with each of the agency's
programs separately may be required to update relevant information,
depending on individual circumstances.

Deceased customer on reporting at time of death

If earnings for the last period:

-   are known, these must be recorded before stimulating the payment
-   are not known, the payment must still be stimulated

After the payment is stimulated, the customer should be taken off
reporting before recording the death action. This does not apply if a
JobSeeker Payment and Youth Allowance customer dies. Payments for these
customers can be stimulated after the death action has been finalised.

Providing assistance

The type of assistance that can be provided may depend on a number of
factors, including the type of payment received by the customer and
their partner and the length of time they have been receiving payments.

Before any action can be taken, the death must be confirmed.

The notification period for the occurrence of a bereavement event is 28
days.
