This document outlines the eligibility criteria for Voluntary Income
Management

On this Page:

Voluntary Income Management (VIM)

Customers who have difficulty budgeting and need help to manage their
income support payments can volunteer for Income Management.

Note: a State or Territory Child Protection Authority, Supporting People
at Risk (SPaR) approved referring authority or a State or Territory
Housing Authority can also refer a customer to Services Australia to
discuss Voluntary Income Management. When a referral is received from an
external organisation, it is not compulsory for customers to attend any
appointments to discuss Income Management or enter into a Voluntary
Income Management Agreement.

Eligibility criteria for VIM

To be eligible for Voluntary Income Management the customer must be in
receipt of a category H welfare payment and:

-   reside in a declared Income Management area, and
-   not have an excluded payment nominee for Income Management purposes

Ineligible customers

Customers cannot enter into a Voluntary Income Management Agreement:

-   if it is not feasible for Services Australia to apply Income
    Management in relation to the customer
-   if the customer is subject to a measure higher in the hierarchy of
    Income Management measures or Nominee Income Management (NIM), or
    will become eligible for a compulsory measure of Income Management
    within the next 28 days
-   if a Voluntary Income Management Agreement has been terminated by
    the customer within the last 21 days, the agency must not enter into
    another agreement with the customer until 21 days has elapsed from
    the date of termination, or
-   if an agreement has been cancelled on 4 or more occasions in the 12
    month period preceding the date on which the new agreement is
    intended to commence

Voluntary Income Management will commence from the date the assessment
is completed, a future start date cannot be recorded.

Considerations

In deciding whether to enter into a Voluntary Income Management
Agreement with a customer, the agency must consider whether it is
feasible this will meet the customer and their family’s priority needs.
The agency must also consider any other relevant matters (if any). This
discretion allows the agency to refuse to enter into a Voluntary Income
Management Agreement if, amongst other things, there is:

-   insufficient availability of approved merchants within the
    customer's geographic location, that is, the agency's ability to
    disburse income managed funds
-   an insufficient rate of payment being received by the customer, that
    is, it may not be feasible to income manage small amounts
-   a likelihood of the customer being ineligible for Voluntary Income
    Management within the next 28 days
-   a likelihood of the customer becoming subject to a different Income
    Management measure within the next 28 days

Duration of VIM

A minimum period of 13 weeks applies when entering into a Voluntary
Income Management Agreement.

Customers may terminate the agreement at any time after the completion
of the 13 week minimum period. The termination request from the customer
must be made over the phone or face-to-face. The customer’s verbal
request and agreement to the termination conditions will be taken as
their written notice to end their agreement. The agency may terminate
the Voluntary Income Management Agreement if certain events occur, for
example, the customer's income support payment is cancelled.

Payments income managed under VIM

The following payments are income managed under this measure:

-   50% of a customer's regular fortnightly Category I welfare payments
    (which includes Category H welfare payments)
-   100% of ABSTUDY (with Living Allowance or Pensioner Education
    Supplement (PES)) payments, and
-   100% of lump sum payments are income managed

There are specific payments not income managed.

Customer moves out of an Income Management (IM) area

Customers who move out of a declared Income Management area must remain
on Voluntary Income Management if they have not yet served the mandatory
13 week period. They can choose to remain on Voluntary Income Management
indefinitely once the mandatory period has been completed.

For more detailed information see, Customer moves out of an Income
Management area.

Restoring VIM customer's payment

Customers income managed under the Voluntary Income Management measure
are required to complete a mandatory period of 13 weeks before being
able to exit Voluntary Income Management. If the agreement has been in
place for less than 13 weeks, Voluntary Income Management will
automatically reinstate on finalisation of the restoration activity.

Customers who have had their agreement in place for more than 13 weeks
will be given the option to continue or terminate the agreement at the
time of restoration.

To access and action the Voluntary Income Management continuation
assessment screen:

-   the Service Officer must be in a restoration or new claim activity
-   the customer must have an active Voluntary Income Management
    Agreement for greater than 13 weeks, and
-   the customer must be residing in a declared Voluntary Income
    Management area (unless the customer has been referred to Voluntary
    Income Management by a child protection authority)
