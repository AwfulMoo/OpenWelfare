| 2                                 | Question: The patient did not     |
|                                   | provide an ESR at baseline but is |

| 6                                 | Question: The prescriber has      |
|                                   | written the prescription for      |
|                                   | Enbrel qty 4. Do I need to        |

|                                   | Answer: You cannot approve        |
|                                   | increased quantities. Approve as  |
|                                   | qty ‘1’. An ‘approved with        |
|                                   | change’ letter is not required in |
|                                   | this instance, as 1 'pack' of     |

|                                   | the database – do I need to       |
|                                   | update?                           |

|                                   | Answer: OPA will advise if the    |
|                                   | Medicare number is current. Check |
|                                   | RPQN (Mainframe) for current      |
|                                   | number if OPA advises the number  |
|                                   | is not valid and update on        |

|                                   | restriction and item code have    |
|                                   | date tabs?                        |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | letter?                           |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | Assessment Date.                  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 10                                | Question: The prescriber has      |
|                                   | requested quantity/repeats higher |
|                                   | than the restriction allows – can |
|                                   | I reduce the number for approval? |
|                                   |                                   |
