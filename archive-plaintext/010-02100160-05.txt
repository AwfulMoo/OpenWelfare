| 1                                 | Full-time student + Read more ... |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Michael is a full-time university |
|                                   | student who is receiving ABSTUDY  |
|                                   | at the away from home rate (and   |
|                                   | so is eligible for FAA). Due to   |
|                                   | personal reasons, Michael is      |
|                                   | unable to undertake 3 of his      |
|                                   | examinations (exams) at the end   |
|                                   | of Semester 2 and so the          |
|                                   | university has granted Michael a  |
|                                   | deferral until mid-January (when  |
|                                   | the university staff return after |
|                                   | Christmas/New Year). In the       |
|                                   | interim period, Michael returns   |
|                                   | home.                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   Michael is eligible for FAA   |
|                                   |     (a return journey) to sit     |
|                                   |     exams. While Michael has 3    |
|                                   |     exams, they are 1 ‘set’, so   |
|                                   |     only 1 lot of FAA is payable  |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Jasmine suffered from food        |
|                                   | poisoning shortly before the last |
|                                   | examination (exam) and was        |
|                                   | granted a week’s deferral.        |
|                                   | Jasmine will now sit the exam on  |
|                                   | the last day of the examination   |
|                                   | period.                           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   FAA is not payable. Although  |
|                                   |     the exam has been deferred,   |
|                                   |     it still falls within the     |
|                                   |     usual examination period.     |

|                                   |     for FAA to study, it is not   |
|                                   |     payable for the exam as it is |
|                                   |     being held at Daniel's normal |
