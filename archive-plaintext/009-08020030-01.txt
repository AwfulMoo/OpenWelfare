This document outlines information for Service Officers creating a carer
link between the carer and care receiver as part of a review process for
Carer Allowance (CA) where the link has been broken.

Creating CA links where the carer link has been broken

CA links are generally established at grant; they link information
between the carer's and care receiver's records. These links also ensure
reviews of Carer Payment (CP) and/or CA are processed at the same time
if the customer is receiving both payments. When CA is reviewed, it may
be necessary to check the Care Receiver Summary (CRS) screen on the
carer's record to see if the current care receiver's name appears and if
a link needs to be re-established. If not already established, or if the
link has been broken and needs to be re-established, the link must be
created by the Service Officer at the time of the CA review.
