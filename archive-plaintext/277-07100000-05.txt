|                                   | reduced because of cut backs by   |
|                                   | the first employer. Having met    |
|                                   | all the criteria and after        |
|                                   | processing Janet's estimate,      |
|                                   | Janet asked if the additional     |

|                                   | the second employer can be        |
|                                   | excluded. Janet has not           |
|                                   | previously applied for PSI to be  |
|                                   | excluded.                         |

|                                   | Janet took on a second job, after |
|                                   | separating to meet additional     |
|                                   | costs incurred when moving into a |
|                                   | new place and setting everything  |
|                                   | up again. Janet explains this     |

|                                   | the estimate of income just       |
|                                   | lodged. The additional income     |
|                                   | from the second job is $7,840.    |

|                                   | Janet started the second job on   |
|                                   | the 30 December 2015 and provides |
|                                   | details of the income prior to    |
|                                   | separation of $50,400 for the     |
|                                   | 2014-15 financial year. The       |
|                                   | estimated income of $51,600 is    |
|                                   | higher than Janet's income prior  |
|                                   | to separation.                    |

|                                   | The decision would be to accept   |
|                                   | Janet's application to exclude    |
|                                   | additional income earned after    |
|                                   | the separation. All the criteria  |
|                                   | were satisfied.                   |

|                                   | increased due to the introduction |
|                                   | of a new product that has been    |
|                                   | developed.                        |

|                                   | Sylvia calls on the 7 June 2016   |
|                                   | asking the additional monies      |
|                                   | received from the new product be  |
|                                   | excluded from Silvia's ATI.       |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sylvia advised that throughout    |
|                                   | the 5 years the business has been |
|                                   | running no new products were      |
|                                   | created to sell in the shop.      |
|                                   | However, after Sylvia separated   |
|                                   | on 22 December 2014 more money    |
|                                   | was needed to pay for necessary   |
|                                   | bills.                            |

|                                   | Sylvia explains the idea of the   |
|                                   | new product was first thought of  |
|                                   | in January 2015 and the new       |
|                                   | product was put on the shelf for  |
|                                   | sale on 3 March 2015.             |

|                                   | Sylvia provided the gross taxable |
|                                   | income for 2013-14 as $18,100     |
|                                   | (income earned prior to           |
|                                   | separation). After separation the |
|                                   | taxable income which includes the |
|                                   | additional income earned is       |
|                                   | $34,500 (2014-15).                |

|                                   | This means that Sylvia's income   |
|                                   | has increased by $16,400. Sylvia  |
|                                   | states that all of the additional |
|                                   | money earned was due to the new   |
|                                   | product line.                     |
