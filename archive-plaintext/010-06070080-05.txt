Further examples - exceptional circumstances

Below are examples of other exceptional circumstances that interfere
with a person's ability to complete a course of education within the
standard minimum duration.

-   illness or injury of a member of the student's immediate family
-   difficult home circumstances (for example, alcoholism, family and
    domestic violence or separation of parents)
-   homelessness
-   death of a close relative or friend
-   the student participated in significant cultural ceremonies (for
    example, initiation) in the case of those adhering to traditional
    Aboriginal cultural practices
-   the student discontinued the previous course because the institution
    ceased to offer the course
-   the student could not proceed in the previous course because of
    course quotas

These examples are not exhaustive. Consider whether the young person's
circumstances might be beyond their control. See the References page for
more information.

Suitable evidence will depend on the circumstances. Encourage customers
to obtain and provide all available evidence to support their claim.
When deciding to accept the exceptional circumstances, consider:

-   how likely it is that they affected the customer's ability and
-   if they are able to complete their course within the satisfactory
    progress and allowable time rules
