|                                   | This is literally having nowhere  |
|                                   | to stay or go and is regarded as  |
|                                   | the worst form of homelessness.   |
|                                   | Also described as being without   |
|                                   | conventional accommodation        |
|                                   | (living on the streets, in        |
|                                   | deserted buildings, railway       |
|                                   | carriages, under bridges etc.)    |

|                                   | This relates to separation from   |
|                                   | traditional land or from family.  |
|                                   | Also described as lacking a sense |
|                                   | of belonging to a place or a      |
|                                   | community, or lacking knowledge   |
|                                   | of one’s identity and role in the |
|                                   | Indigenous community.             |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Where this situation is causing   |
|                                   | considerable stress to families   |
|                                   | and communities. Over-crowding is |
|                                   | a form of homelessness that is    |
|                                   | experienced disproportionately by |
|                                   | Indigenous people, due largely to |
|                                   | their socially disadvantaged      |
|                                   | position. In some cases,          |
|                                   | over-crowding may be preferable   |
|                                   | to literally living on the        |
|                                   | street. This is not a situation   |
|                                   | that many Indigenous people       |
|                                   | believe is acceptable or          |
|                                   | desirable.                        |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Described as moving between       |
|                                   | various forms of temporary        |
|                                   | shelter including friends,        |
|                                   | relatives, youth refuges, night   |
|                                   | shelters, boarding houses,        |
|                                   | hostels and other forms of        |
|                                   | emergency accommodation. This     |
|                                   | results in temporary,             |
|                                   | intermittent and often cyclical   |
|                                   | patterns of homelessness. This    |
|                                   | relates to the necessity of a     |
|                                   | large proportion of the           |
|                                   | Indigenous population having to   |
|                                   | travel to obtain services.        |

|                                   | This applies to individuals who   |
|                                   | have a home, but are forced to    |
|                                   | leave home to escape unstable     |
|                                   | situations for their own safety   |
|                                   | or survival, especially women and |
|                                   | young people. The breakdown of    |
|                                   | traditional ways of dealing with  |
|                                   | violence through family and       |
|                                   | kinship networks may be a         |
|                                   | contributing factor to the        |
|                                   | homelessness experienced by       |
|                                   | victims of family and domestic    |
|                                   | violence.                         |
