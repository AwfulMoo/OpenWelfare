|                                   | Compliance processes currently    |
|                                   | focus on cases where the customer |
|                                   | has had a high number of          |
|                                   | unapproved absences in a term.    |
|                                   | Absence from school does not      |
|                                   | result in loss of qualification   |
|                                   | for payment. However, a high      |
|                                   | level of unapproved absence is an |
|                                   | indicator that the student may    |
|                                   | have ceased studies.              |

|                                   | shows that the student has not    |
|                                   | ceased studies, they remain       |
|                                   | qualified for payment but may     |
|                                   | potentially be required to enter  |
