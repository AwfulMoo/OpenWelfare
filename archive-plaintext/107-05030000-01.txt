This document outlines information on the key points for Debt Management
Officers (DMOs) to consider when reviewing a customer's cash
arrangement.

Reviewing arrangements

Both customers and Debt Management Officers (DMOs) can initiate a review
of an arrangement.

A customer's arrangement can be ended without notice if the customer:

-   requested the change
-   has not disclosed information about their true capacity to repay
    their debt
-   breaks the arrangement such as the status of the arrangement is BKN

Otherwise, give the customer 28 days’ notice before a cash arrangement
is:

-   altered, or
-   terminated

Withholdings

Non-standard withholding arrangements with an arrangement end date are
automatically reviewed. Assist these customers at the first point of
contact. All other withholdings reviews are the responsibility of the
Debt Management Branch (DMB). See Withholdings.
