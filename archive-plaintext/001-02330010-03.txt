|                                   | Assessment Services are           |

|                                   | appointments, for example, where  |
|                                   | the customer contacts to say that |
|                                   | they will be unable to attend a   |
|                                   | future booked appointment, and    |
|                                   | wishes to arrange a new           |
|                                   | appointment time.                 |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | There may be situations where an  |
|                                   | ESAt request is made but is no    |
|                                   | longer required. In these cases,  |
|                                   | the customer will need to be      |
|                                   | transferred to Assessment         |
|                                   | Services.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Reasons for this may include the  |
|                                   | following:                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   the customer withdraws their  |
|                                   |     claim                         |
|                                   | -   the customer has changed      |
|                                   |     address and moved out of the  |
|                                   |     area, so the assessment       |
|                                   |     appointment needs to be       |
|                                   |     rebooked in the new area (for |
|                                   |     face-to-face appointments)    |
|                                   | -   the request was made in error |
|                                   | -   the Service Officer           |
|                                   |     determines that an ESAt       |
|                                   |     initiated by the Job Seeker   |
|                                   |     Snapshot is no longer         |
|                                   |     required                      |
|                                   | -   the job seeker is not         |
|                                   |     receiving a payment with      |
|                                   |     mutual obligation             |
|                                   |     requirements and does not     |
|                                   |     wish to proceed with an ESAt  |
|                                   |     appointment. In these cases,  |
|                                   |     the job seeker registration   |
|                                   |     should be inactivated         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the ESAt is no longer required |
|                                   | or an existing appointment        |
|                                   | requires rescheduling, contact    |
|                                   | Assessment Services with an       |
|                                   | explanation. After making the     |
|                                   | request, record details on a DOC. |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Assessment Services will decide   |
|                                   | whether the ESAt request can be   |
|                                   | finalised as 'unable to           |
|                                   | complete'.                        |
