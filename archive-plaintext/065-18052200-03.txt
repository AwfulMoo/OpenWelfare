Updating events

Table 3: this table describes how to update home care events ACMPS.
Flexible care events are updated in the Aged Care Staff Portal (ACSP) –
Service in Context.

Note: when deleting multiple events, Service Officers must ensure this
occurs in a specific date order from the newest to oldest for event
sequencing purposes. For example, if the initial events sequence were
entry, leave and departure, delete, departure, leave and entry events in
that order. This makes sure the correct claim processing occurs.

Finalising claims

Table 4: this table describes how to finalise claims. Before a claim can
be calculated, there are some basic pre-conditions that need to be met.
If these are not met, then the claim cannot proceed to the calculation
and payment processes. Note: a claim must be registered before it can be
finalised.

Retrospective claim approvals

Table 8: this table describes how to approve a retrospective claim. This
can occur when the claim amount has been calculated. Multiple claims can
be approved at the same time.

Note: a Team Leader or a Subject Matter Expert (SME) from the Aged Care
Payments Team (Aged Care and Allied Health Branch) can approve claims in
ACMPS . This can be done in either ACMPS, or the Aged Care Staff Portal
(ACSP). See Step 8 in the Using the Aged Care Staff Portal home page
table for details on the Claim Search screen.

Table 10: this table describes the process for Service Officers creating
the events, manual adjustments and payment statement notes in relation
to events outside the 2 year limit. If an event is outside the 2 year
limit, it is forwarded to the delegate in the Aged Care Payments Team
(the Aged Care and Allied Health Branch) for approval or rejection.

in ACMPS, see Table 9.

Maintain care level details

Table 16: this table describes how to record when a care recipient has
moved from one care level to another. This process is applicable where a
care recipient had changed their level of care prior to 27 February 2017
and to care level changes that occurred prior to 27 February 2017 if
notification is received after 27 February 2017.

From 27 February 2017, all home care package level changes are
automatically updated by the Department of Health via the National
Screening Assessment Form (NSAF).
