+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | Meaning of a person or their      |
|                                   | partner receiving FTB at more     |
|                                   | than the base rate                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A person may be considered to be  |
|                                   | entitled to FTB at more than the  |
|                                   | base rate even though they may    |
|                                   | not be receiving their full       |
|                                   | entitlement by instalments. A     |
|                                   | person can choose to receive less |
|                                   | than their fortnightly            |
|                                   | entitlement by taking up an       |
|                                   | option under More Choice For      |
|                                   | Families. The person is choosing  |
|                                   | to receive a notional entitlement |
|                                   | as opposed to their legislative   |
|                                   | entitlement. The decision about   |
|                                   | whether they are receiving more   |
|                                   | than the base rate for the        |
|                                   | purpose of subsection 151A should |
|                                   | be based on the person’s          |
|                                   | legislative entitlement.          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A blended family is a couple with |
|                                   | more than 1 child in their care,  |
|                                   | where:                            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   1 child is from a previous    |
|                                   |     relationship of 1 member of   |
|                                   |     the couple, and               |
|                                   | -   another child is from the     |
|                                   |     current relationship, or from |
|                                   |     the previous relationship of  |
|                                   |     the other member of the       |
|                                   |     couple                        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Members of a blended family may   |
|                                   | choose for 1 person to claim FTB  |
|                                   | or for each member of the couple  |
|                                   | to claim and receive a nominated  |
|                                   | percentage of the family's FTB    |
|                                   | entitlement. Therefore, the       |
|                                   | situation may arise where the     |
|                                   | partner of the payee is receiving |
|                                   | FTB in respect of the child       |
|                                   | support child.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Up to 30 June 2018, section 151A  |
|                                   | applied to payees where they or   |
|                                   | their current partner were        |
|                                   | entitled to receive more than the |
|                                   | base rate FTB for the child and   |
|                                   | restricted their option to elect  |
|                                   | the end a child support           |
|                                   | assessment. This is because the   |
|                                   | maintenance action test (MAT)     |
|                                   | applies to both the FTB recipient |
|                                   | and their partner, that is, the   |
|                                   | case ending may cause FTB         |
|                                   | recipient to fail the MAT.        |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | From 1 July 2018 section 151A has |
|                                   | been removed, and there is no     |
|                                   | restriction on a payee electing   |
|                                   | to end their child support        |
|                                   | assessment, no matter what        |
|                                   | Centrelink benefits or FTB rate   |
|                                   | they or their partner are         |
|                                   | entitled to receive.              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | However, if a payee or their      |
|                                   | current partner is receiving, or  |
|                                   | is entitled to receive more than  |
|                                   | the base rate of Family Tax       |
|                                   | Benefit (FTB) Part A, and they    |
|                                   | end the child support assessment, |
|                                   | they will only be entitled to the |
|                                   | base rate of FTB. Ending the      |
|                                   | child support assessment may also |
|                                   | impact their eligibility for      |

|                                   | If the customer wants more        |
