Allowable and reasonable time

Allowable and reasonable time for full-time students and concessional
study load students is based on the normal duration of the course and
type of payment. For information about the normal duration of a course,
see Determining minimum (normal) time for a course of study.

A series of articulated short courses are viewed as being one long
course. For more information, see Effect of articulated short courses of
study on continuing payments.

Note: the Allowable Time End Date: field on the Education Course Details
(EDC) screen does not necessarily have to be coded for each student.
However, it should be coded when the allowable time is expected to
expire prior to the student completing their course. Where allowable
time has been calculated by the system in a new claim as a date later
than the student end date, it is not necessary for staff to remove this
coding. Quality checkers are not required to provide feedback in
relation to allowable time coding unless it will result in incorrect,
early cancellation or suspension.

Any decision made to disregard previous study or determine allowable
time based on study load must be clearly documented on the customer's
record.

Determine allowable time and reasonable time for a course of study

This table describes how to determine the allowable time and reasonable
time for full-time and concessional study load students based on the
normal duration of the course and type of payment.
