This document explains the role and responsibilities of Smart Centre
Service Officers when seeking help from TPS.

Checklist before seeking help

There is an expectation that Smart Centre Service Officers will:

Research thoroughly using a range of online tools and reference material
before contacting a TPS. For example:

-   Operational Blueprint
-   Network News Update (NNU)
-   Office Locator
-   mySupport
-   Roxy Digital Assistant response, and
-   Process Direct current issues

Contact a TPS if an activity results in arrears or a negative adjustment
and the Service Officer is not sure if this result is correct based on
the reference material used

Contact TPS if the status or rate of payment does not reflect
information on the record, if the system will not allow updates or when
coding results in an error and relevant reference material does not
provide a solution

Smart Centre Service Officers must not:

-   contact a TPS to confirm information found in reference material or
    that an activity is correct before completion
-   contact Services Australia policy units, unless instructed
-   contact a Service Centre or other Zone teams directly for technical
    advice

The Resources page contains tables for Telephony Technical Support and
Boutique Technical Support, intranet links for webforms and a link to
mySupport for valid reasons to call the urgent escalation channel.
