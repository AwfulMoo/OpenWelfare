Fair Work Ombudsman

Check the current rate of the national minimum wage on the Fair Work
Ombudsman website. Some employees have a different minimum wage
depending on their employment type, age or work capacity.

Examples - deciding if part-time work satisfies mutual obligation requirements

Note: the amount of $23.23 per hour used below for the national minimum
wage is based on the rate as of 1st July 2023 and is for illustration
purposes only. This is the base rate for adult employees in the national
system who are award free and may be substituted for people in
occupations covered by an award which provides a rate of pay which is
lower than the national minimum wage or where junior/ trainee rates
apply.

Service Officers must check the Fair Work Commission's website for the
latest national minimum wage when assessing a job seeker's
circumstances.

|                                   | principal carer with a dependent  |
|                                   | child under 8 years old. Aminah   |
|                                   | can satisfy mutual obligation     |
|                                   | requirements by working 30 hours  |
|                                   | per fortnight. Aminah currently   |
|                                   | works 20 hours a week at a shop   |
|                                   | owned by relatives. They pay      |
|                                   | $13.00 an hour so Aminah earns    |
|                                   | $260.00 a week. Aminah will       |
|                                   | satisfy the sufficient work test  |
|                                   | if earning at least $696.90 per   |
|                                   | fortnight, which equals 30 hours  |
|                                   | at $23.23 per hour. As the        |
|                                   | earnings exceed this requirement  |
|                                   | and Aminah is working at least 30 |
|                                   | hours per fortnight, the          |
|                                   | sufficient work test is           |
|                                   | satisfied.                        |

|                                   | If Aminah was working 20 hours a  |
|                                   | week for $5.00 an hour, the       |
|                                   | sufficient work test would not be |
|                                   | satisfied. Aminah would have to   |
|                                   | look for alternative work.        |

|                                   | hours per week. Cheung will       |
|                                   | satisfy the mutual obligation     |
|                                   | requirements if working 30 hours  |
|                                   | per fortnight and the earnings    |
|                                   | are equivalent to the national    |
|                                   | minimum wage for the minimum      |
|                                   | number of required hours. Cheung  |
|                                   | works for 20 hours a fortnight,   |
|                                   | earning $26.00 an hour, or        |
|                                   | $520.00 a fortnight. Cheung will  |
|                                   | satisfy the remuneration test if  |
|                                   | earning at least $696.90 a        |
|                                   | fortnight, which equals 30 hours  |
|                                   | at $23.23 per hour. Cheung earns  |
|                                   | more than this, so the            |
|                                   | remuneration test is satisfied.   |
|                                   |                                   |

|                                   | required, so the sufficient work  |
|                                   | test is not met. Cheung will need |

|                                   | has been receiving the current    |
|                                   | income support payment for more   |
|                                   | than 12 months. Wendy is          |
|                                   | currently doing 20 hours a        |
|                                   | fortnight approved voluntary work |
|                                   | and works part-time for a total   |
|                                   | of 10 hours per fortnight. As     |
|                                   | Wendy is doing a combination of   |
|                                   | approved voluntary work and paid  |
|                                   | work of at least 30 hours per     |
|                                   | fortnight, Wendy can use them to  |
|                                   | satisfy the mutual obligation     |
|                                   | requirements if the income from   |
|                                   | the part-time work satisfies the  |
|                                   | national minimum wage. Wendy is   |
|                                   | paid $10 an hour in the part-time |
|                                   | job so earns $100.00 per          |
|                                   | fortnight. This will not satisfy  |
|                                   | the sufficient work test, as the  |
|                                   | remuneration is insufficient.     |
|                                   | Wendy needs to earn at least      |
|                                   | $232.30, which equates to 10      |
|                                   | hours at the minimum wage rate of |
|                                   | $23.23 an hour.                   |

|                                   | this is more than the required    |
|                                   | number of hours, and as the pay   |
|                                   | now exceeds $232.30 per           |

|                                   | is satisfied. Wendy is therefore  |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Elissa is a principal carer       |
|                                   | parent of a 10 year old. Elissa   |
|                                   | can satisfy the mutual obligation |
|                                   | requirements by working 30 hours  |
|                                   | per fortnight. Elissa sells Avon  |
|                                   | on a commission basis and         |
|                                   | receives this income monthly.     |
|                                   | Elissa works 30 hours per         |
|                                   | fortnight and meets the           |
|                                   | sufficient work test. However,    |
|                                   | the affecting income is only      |
|                                   | $50.00 per fortnight. Elissa is   |
|                                   | not meeting the income test and   |
|                                   | therefore not fully meeting the   |
|                                   | requirements. Elissa will need to |
|                                   | look for work that will meet the  |
|                                   | 30 hour requirement as well as    |
|                                   | earning the equivalent of the     |
|                                   | national minimum wage for 30      |
|                                   | hours for $696.90 per fortnight   |
|                                   | (based on the rate as of 1st July |
|                                   | 2023).                            |

|                                   | Dave receives JSP as a principal  |

|                                   | fortnight. Dave declares earnings |
|                                   | of $464.60 per fortnight. This is |
|                                   | equivalent to the national        |
|                                   | minimum wage of $23.23 an hour    |
|                                   | for 20 hours per fortnight. Dave  |
|                                   | fully satisfies the remuneration  |

|                                   | at least 30 hours per fortnight.  |
