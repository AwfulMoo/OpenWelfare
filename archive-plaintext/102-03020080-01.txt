This document outlines some general points to consider when starting and
monitoring the progress of an Inter-environment Change of Address
(ICoA). The Centrelink computer system divides Australia into a series
of geographically-based environments. When a customer changes their
address from one environment to another, their computer file record must
also be transferred. The ICoA facility is used to transfer records
between environments.

Delay or prevention of transfer

As the ICoA facility requires action in two environments, there are
various factors which can delay or prevent the transfer being finalised.
This requires regular monitoring of the activities to ensure all
appropriate action is taken until a transfer finalises. When a transfer
is delayed for no obvious reason see Inter-environment Change of Address
(ICoA) facility problem escalation process.

Customer requests review officer bypass

It should be noted that an Inter-environment transfer fails, with error
code 'EO761T, Appeals Incomplete ODM Reconsideration exists', where the
review officer reconsideration is bypassed at the customer's request.
Further information regarding transferring the customer record to the
gaining environment in this instance can be found on the
Inter-environment change of address (ICoA) transfer of a customer record
page.
