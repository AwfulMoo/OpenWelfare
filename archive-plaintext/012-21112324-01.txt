This document outlines the COVID-19 Vaccine Claims Scheme (CVCS).

Government intent

In August 2021, the Australian Government agreed to implement a claims
scheme for people who suffer a moderate to significant impact following
an adverse reaction to a Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved
COVID-19 vaccine.

The CVCS will provide a simple, streamlined process to
reimburse/compensate eligible people for their injuries without the need
for complex legal proceedings.

The CVCS will cover the costs of injuries $1,000 and above due to:

-   administration of a TGA approved COVID-19 vaccine, or
-   an adverse event that is considered to be caused by a COVID-19
    vaccination

The CVCS Policy 2021 outlines:

-   the rules that govern the arrangements made for the purpose of this
    scheme
-   the basis on which the Commonwealth may deem a claim eligible, and
-   the end date of the CVCS

Tier 1 claims

received a TGA approved COVID-19 vaccine as part of the approved vaccine
program

suffered Harm due to the COVID-19 vaccination, and

incurred Past Loss and Future Loss of $1,000 or greater, but below the
maximum claim amount of:

-   $15,999 if claiming pain and suffering, or
-   $20,000 if not claiming pain and suffering

was hospitalised due to the COVID-19 vaccine-related Harm, or received
outpatient care as a result of adverse effects of the vaccine

-   $20,000 or more if not claiming pain and suffering

was hospitalised due to the COVID-19 vaccine-related Harm, or received
outpatient care as a result of adverse effects of the vaccine
