This document outlines how loan repayments (including credit cards) are
assessed as maintenance income (which can affect the rate of Family Tax
Benefit (FTB) Part A) when provided as child support or spousal
maintenance.

Assessing loan repayments as maintenance income

The 3 things to consider when assessing loan repayments as maintenance
income are:

-   is the payment from a person liable to pay child support or spousal
    maintenance
-   is the customer or child able to use the asset (or credit card)
-   in whose name is the loan

Paying off a debt for the customer is not child support unless the
customer is able to use the asset (or credit card).

Joint loans and ownership

If parents have a joint loan for an asset, the asset is taken to be
jointly owned unless a property settlement has been finalised. If the
asset is jointly owned, only 50% of any loan repayments by the payer can
be assessed as child support.

Child support agreements

Child support agreements with a start date of 1 July 2008 or later are
no longer manually assessed or coded by Centrelink staff, they are
assessed by Child Support.

For agreements with a start date before 1 July 2008, any non-cash
maintenance must be manually recorded on the Centrelink system for the
period up to and including 30 June 2008. For agreements in place before
1 July 2008 that have been accepted by Child Support and transitioned
under the Child Support Scheme Reforms from 1 July 2008, non-cash
maintenance previously coded on the Centrelink system is maintained by
Centrelink.

The Resources page contains examples of assessing loan repayments as
maintenance income.
