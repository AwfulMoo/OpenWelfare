This document outlines how to action multiple Centrelink Customer
Reference Numbers (CRN). This process is for Data Quality Unit (DQU)
staff only.

DQU staff action multiple CRNs

A multiple CRN occurs when DQU staff have completed a Same Person
Assessment and have found a Centrelink customer has more than one
customer record.

Multiple CRNs are actioned only by DQU staff, who complete a primary CRN
determination and, where possible, use the Delete Person (DP) function
to delete any multiple record(s).

If a multiple record cannot be deleted it will be linked to its primary
record with a multiple CRN (MLC) link. A Display on Access (DOA) DOC
will be added to the primary CRN.

On entering the multiple CRN the following Multiple and Intertwined
Warning (MIW) screen will display:

-   ‘This record has been assessed as a multiple and cannot be used for
    the customer. The customer's primary record is 123 456 789X. Do you
    wish to proceed? N’

Service Officer’s can enter ‘Y’ to access the record in ‘read only’
mode.

The Resources page contains a link to the Intertwined Referral form.
