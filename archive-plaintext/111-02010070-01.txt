This document outlines the process of accessing archived Emergency
Payment (EMG) data using the Archiving and Culling Engine (ACE)
application.

General rules for archiving EMG records

The general rules for archiving EMG records are:

-   The record must have been cancelled for three or more years
-   The record must not have a recent or unfinalised Debt, Appeal,
    Prosecution or Compensation activity

Not all data for a 3 year old cancelled record is archived. Only
Assessment and Circumstance data relevant to EMG is archived. No Person
data or common Circumstance data is archived, and this data is retained
in the Centrelink system for use by other mainframe Common Platform
Systems.

After a record has been archived, the EMG data normally displayed on the
mainframe system will be displayed in a similar format in ACE.

The Resources page contains a link to the Archiving and Culling Engine
(ACE).
