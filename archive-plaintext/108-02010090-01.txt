This document outlines details for assessing and coding parental income
for ABSTUDY, AIC Scheme and YA.

Accepting an estimate of parental income

The Parental Income Test (PIT) is usually applied to dependent Youth
Allowance, ABSTUDY and Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) Scheme
customers, unless an exemption applies. The application of the PIT
requires Services Australia to collect taxable income from
parent(s)/guardian(s).

A reasonable estimate of parental income can be used to apply the PIT
where the:

-   parent(s)/guardian(s) do not have taxable income that is assessed by
    the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)
-   actual income for the relevant financial year is not known by the
    parent(s)/guardian(s)

These situations may occur when:

-   parent(s)/guardian(s) has been given an extension by the ATO to
    lodge their tax return, or
-   the ATO is yet to make an assessment, or
-   a current tax year assessment is in place

Verification of income estimates

If the Service Officer is in doubt that the estimate is reasonable, they
may ask the parent(s)/guardian(s) to give written verification of the
estimate. For example:

-   a letter from the accountant/tax agent advising an estimate of
    parental income, or
-   a Payment Summary and a statutory declaration

If the parent(s)/guardian(s) give a reasonable estimate, they must
provide verification of the actual income as soon as it is available.

Debts

Debts may be raised for ABSTUDY and AIC Additional Boarding Allowance
(ABA) payments if the actual income figures are higher than the
estimates provided and the estimate used to calculate their rate of
payment was over the Parental Income Free Area.

AIC Scheme debts are usually the responsibility of the applicant, but in
some circumstances, may be the responsibility of a third party. This
could be an educational institution, parent or guardian. Check to
confirm which party directly received the overpayment.

For YA, debts are only raised in certain circumstances. Only Service
Officers trained in debt raising should make decisions about whether an
overpayment for YA as a result of the application of PIT is a legally
recoverable debt.

For staff trained in raising debts, see Raising Parental Income Test
(PIT) debts.
