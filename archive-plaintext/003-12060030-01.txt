If you have concerns about a child’s safety, conduct the risk and
referral process.

For Services Australia social workers only

This document outlines the role of Services Australia social workers
have in assessing SpB claims.

Social worker involvement

For some SpB categories, a social work referral is recommended or
mandatory.

For example, a social work assessment is often essential in determining
if a customer under 18 years of age is eligible for SpB under
Unreasonable to Live at Home (UTLAH) provisions. If the customer is
under 16 years of age and claiming SpB, referral to a social worker is
mandatory.

When reviewing and speaking with the customer, if complex
vulnerabilities and limited existing supports are identified, the
parent/nominee should be referred to a social worker as per existing
processes. See Risk identification and management of threats to the
safety or welfare of a child.

The SpB categories where social worker involvement is needed or
recommended are:

-   Customers under 16 years of age (USY)
-   Australian Citizen Children (ACC) & Australian Permanent Resident
    Children in the custody of a Non-permanent Resident
-   Assurance of Support (AOS)
-   Newly Arrived Residents (NAR) - help in assessing substantial change
    in circumstances beyond the customer's control
-   Partner Provisional Visas (PPV)
-   Socially Marginalised (SOM) customers
-   Not residentially qualified for the Disability Support Pension (NRD)
-   Caring for a child (CFC)
-   Caring for an incapacitated person (CIP)
-   Other cases - short term (OST)

Assessments and the forms used to refer customers to State or Territory
Welfare Authorities.
