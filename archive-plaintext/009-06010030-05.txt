| 1                                 | General information - extending   |
|                                   | 63 days under special             |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | There is the discretion to        |
|                                   | approve payment for temporary     |
|                                   | absences (respite) exceeding the  |
|                                   | 63 day limit. This should only    |
|                                   | occur when the absence is         |
|                                   | temporary and there are special   |
|                                   | or unusual circumstances.         |
|                                   | Generally this would be a         |
|                                   | situation beyond the              |
|                                   | parent's/carer's control,         |
|                                   | necessitating additional respite  |
|                                   | care. A special circumstance is   |
|                                   | determined by the APS 5/6 level   |
|                                   | officer. The APS 5/6 level        |
|                                   | officer does not have to occupy   |
|                                   | any particular position for them  |
|                                   | to have the delegation for this   |
|                                   | decision, however the delegate    |
|                                   | will usually be the supervisor of |
|                                   | the Processing Service actioning  |
|                                   | the review.                       |

|                                   | ...                               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A single parent has used 55 days  |
|                                   | of temporary absence for respite  |
|                                   | care during the year. They then   |
|                                   | unexpectedly require              |
|                                   | hospitalisation themselves, for   |
|                                   | two weeks. It would be            |
|                                   | appropriate in this case to       |
|                                   | extend the 63 day limit.          |

|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | A care receiver uses overnight    |
|                                   | formal respite care on a regular  |
|                                   | basis. By September the carer has |
|                                   | used 60 days of respite during    |
|                                   | the calendar year, and wishes to  |
|                                   | use a further 10 days. It would   |
|                                   | not be appropriate to extend the  |
|                                   | 63 day respite limit to allow     |
|                                   | them to continue to have regular  |
|                                   | days off.                         |
