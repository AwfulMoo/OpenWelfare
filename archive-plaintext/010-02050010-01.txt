who have not been classed as having independent status and are also not
eligible for the away from home rate.

For the purposes of assessing ABSTUDY Living Allowance the following are
regarded as students and Australian Apprentices living at home:

-   students or Australian Apprentices who live at their permanent home
    for ABSTUDY purposes
-   students or Australian Apprentices who live away from the permanent
    home to study or undertake the Australian Apprenticeship but do not
    meet the criteria for the away from home rate
-   students or Australian Apprentices who would be eligible for the
    away from home rate but who choose not to live away from home to
    study or undertake the Australian Apprenticeship
-   students and Australian Apprentices in State care whose foster
    parents are receiving a Foster Care Allowance.
