|                                   | When caring for someone with a    |
|                                   | disability, carers are often      |
|                                   | faced with pressures beyond those |
|                                   | which have a financial basis. It  |
|                                   | is important that carers are      |
|                                   | given information on government   |
|                                   | assistance as well as private     |
