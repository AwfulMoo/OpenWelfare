This document outlines the calculators and tools available to debt
raising staff.

Debt calculators and tools

Debt calculators are available to help Service Officers calculate the
correct customer entitlement:

Use the Debt Explanation tool (ADEX) in all cases where it is possible
and practical. Note: debts generated in Process Direct do not have ADEX

Use the MultiCal debt calculator when the Centrelink system calculation
is not possible. The calculator cannot be used for payments such as:

-   ABSTUDY
-   Child Care Subsidy (CCS)
-   Family Tax Benefit (FTB), or
-   Family Payments prior to the introduction of FTB on 1 July 2000

In addition to the debt calculators, there is:

-   Earnings Apportionment Tool (EAT)
-   Payment Details Download Sheet (PS Tool)

Accessing the calculators and tools

Staff can access the debt calculators and tools by going to the
Calculators and Tools page on the Intranet. See the Resources page for a
link.
