This document outlines the process which will assist in the completion
of the Statement form (SS075). The SS075 aims to assist staff to gather
the required information in a standard format.

When the Statement form is used

The form is used for Services Australia payments, and should be used by
current or prospective customers only.

While the form is usually completed by a Service Officer, customers also
have the option of writing the statement themselves. If the form is
completed by a Service Officer the customer must read the statement (or
have it read to them) and agree on the content. Customers must sign the
form acknowledging that the information is complete, correct and in
order for it to be valid.

Once completed the form is kept on the customer's record.

The Resources page contains a link to the online version of the SS075.
