when a manual letter can be issued to confirm CSR to zero.

Care subsidy reduction and ITCF/MTCF

The Australian Government contributes to the costs of aged care through
subsidies paid to aged care providers. Once a care recipient enters care
an assessment is completed. This decides the cost of care. A means
assessment is completed which decides the contribution to the cost based
on their income and/or assets. The fee reduces the care subsidy paid to
the provider. This is known as a ‘care subsidy reduction’ (CSR). This
applies to eligible care recipients assessed under Post 1 July 2014
assessment rules only.

Residential care

-   The CSR is equal to the means tested care fee (MTCF)
-   In the System for the Payment of Aged Residential care (SPARC) it is
    displayed as a Means Tested Subsidy Reduction (MTSR)

Home care

-   The CSR is equal to the income tested care fee (ITCF)
-   In the Aged Care Management Payment System (ACMPS) payment
    statements for providers displays it as an Income Tested Subsidy
    Reduction (ITSR)

For example, a care recipient is assessed as requiring the highest level
of care. The provider is eligible to receive maximum subsidies for the
care recipient. A means assessment is then completed. This decides that
the care recipient is liable to pay $50 per day for an ITCF/MTCF. The
care subsidy paid to the provider is then reduced by $50 per day.

Care subsidy reduction to zero

In certain circumstances a care recipient’s care subsidy reduction (CSR)
can be ‘set’ to zero. The legislation outlines ‘classes’ (categories) of
people where the CSR is taken to zero. Where applicable, it also
outlines the duration the CSR to zero applies.

If a care recipient’s CSR is set to zero they do not have to pay any
ITCF/MTCF for that period. The government will pay the maximum eligible
subsidy to the service provider. They still have to pay any Basic Daily
Fee (BDF) and Accommodation costs (for residential care).

Care subsidy reduction to zero criteria

Care recipients are eligible to have their CSR set to zero when they:

-   have 1 or more dependent children
-   are described in paragraph 85 (4)(b) of the Veterans’ Entitlements
    Act (which describes former prisoners of war)
-   have an assessed care subsidy reduction that is less than $1

For residential care recipients CSR is set to zero when they:

-   leave a residential care service (without entering another
    residential care service), or who die, before the service provider
    has been informed of the care recipient’s care subsidy reduction (if
    any)
-   are not within 6 months of entry to the residential care service,
    informed of the care recipient’s care subsidy reduction (if any)

For home care recipients CSR is set to zero when they:

-   stop being provided with home care (without being provided with
    other home care), or who die, before the approved provider is
    informed of the person’s care subsidy reduction (if any)
-   are not within 6 months of receiving home care, informed of the care
    recipient’s care subsidy (if any)

CSR to zero – care recipient not advised of fees within 6 months

When a care recipient is in home or residential care they are issued
with an initial fee advice letter. A pre-entry advice does not qualify
as a fee advice. It provides an estimate of fees only. If a fee advice
is not issued within 6 months of entry into care CSR to zero is
automatically applied. It is applied by the aged care system and starts
from the date of entry until the day before advice is issued.

Home care

-   CSR to zero is automatically applied by ACMPS
-   Series 9 advices will be issued advising the period of CSR to zero
    and the care recipient’s ongoing fees

Residential care

-   CSR to zero is automatically applied by SPARC
-   Series 9 advices will be triggered by SPARC and issued from ACMPS
    advising of CSR to zero period and the care recipient’s ongoing fees

CSR to zero – care recipient discharged before provider receives fee advice

When a care recipient has been discharged from care before the provider
receives a fee advice CSR is automatically applied. This includes when a
care recipient is discharged from care within 7 days of a fee advice
being issued. The provider is considered to have not received the advice
before discharge. Provider subsidies will be adjusted by the aged care
system. No fee advice letters are issued.

Service Officers can receive requests to issue fee advice letters
confirming ITCF/MTCF has been set as $0 for the period of care. These
letters are manually issued:

Where the care recipient is deceased:

-   only the executor of the estate is able to request a manual letter
-   evidence is required to verify that the person requesting the letter
    is the executor or administrator of the estate

Where the care recipient is not deceased:

-   the care recipient or their nominee can request a manual letter

Where a care recipient enters a new facility, legislation does not state
how long the break between care needs to be. Whether the break between
care is one day or 2 years, the SPARC system applies the policy business
rules where an unmatched record will have CSR to zero applied upon
discharge. Where there is a discharge on an unmatched record, CSR to
zero is applied, irrespective of whether another admission occurs.

Income tested reduction for pre 1 July 2014 care recipients

Care recipients assessed under pre 1 July 2014 assessment schemes can
complete an income assessment. This decides the amount of income tested
fee (ITF) they are to pay. If they choose not to complete an income
assessment they pay full ITF. This reduces the amount of care subsidy
paid to a provider. This was known as an Income Tested Reduction (ITR)
or an Income Tested Subsidy Reduction (ITSR) in SPARC.

Pre 1 July 2014 care recipients are eligible for their ITR to be
assessed as zero when they:

-   have 1 or more dependent children
-   are described in paragraph 85 (4)(b) of the Veterans’ Entitlements
    Act (which describes former prisoners of war)
-   have a care subsidy reduction that is worked out to be less than $1
-   leave a residential care service (without entering another
    residential care service), or who die, before the service provider
    has been informed of the care recipient’s care subsidy reduction (if
    any)
-   are not, within 6 months of entry to the residential care service,
    informed of the care recipient’s care subsidy reduction (if any)
