profile for IM (Disengaged Youth (DEY) or Long Term Welfare Payment
Recipient (LTWPR) based in the Northern Territory (NT) can permanently

This document outlines the Initial Assessment interview held prior to a
customer commencing Income Management.

On this Page:

Initial assessment interview

When a customer is identified for or referred for Income Management,
they are sent a letter requesting they contact Services Australia to
arrange an Initial Assessment interview.

An Initial Assessment interview is required to place a customer on any
measure of Income Management. In summary, the interview:

-   explains in detail how Income Management works
-   determines how their income managed funds can be best used to meet
    their priority needs and those of their family
-   provides information about other services which may assist them,
    including Centrepay
-   explains how they can request reviews of Income Management decisions

The interview provides an opportunity to advise customers in profile for
IM (Disengaged Youth (DEY) or Long Term Welfare Payment Recipient
(LTWPR) who live in the Northern Territory they do not have to start IM,
but instead permanently transition to the Cashless Debit Card.

Documentation required

Customers should be advised to bring information about their regular or
known expenses to their Initial Assessment interview to assist in
setting up appropriate allocations. Recommended documentation:

-   utility and telephone bills to obtain provider details and account
    information
-   regular expense information, for example, food, clothing, school
    fees
-   details of any known future expenses, for example, motor vehicle
    registration, travel expenses
-   rent certificate or lease agreement. This should be provided if the
    customer wishes to pay rent to a head tenant or private landlord

Use of interpreters

Customers who have limited or no use of the English language or, are
deaf or hearing impaired, should have access to an interpreter for
Initial Assessment interviews.

A qualified interpreter should be used rather than a friend or relative.
For more information see Booking an interpreter for an appointment.

Failure to attend interview

If a customer does not attend an Initial Assessment interview within
their Income Management engagement period, Income Management will be
automatically applied to their payments.

If a customer still does not attend an Initial Assessment interview 28
days after Auto Income Management commences, their payment may be
suspended.

Nominee arrangements

If a customer has a payment nominee who is not an excluded payment
nominee for income management purposes, the nominee must attend the
Initial Assessment interview as they are responsible for managing the
customer's payments.

Exemptions and exclusions

The Initial Assessment interview also provides information to eligible
customers about an exemption or exclusion from Income Management:

-   Exemptions: available to Disengaged Youth and Long Term Welfare
    Payment Recipients customers only. For more information, see
    Customers requesting an exemption from Income Management
-   Exclusions: available to automatically triggered Vulnerable Welfare
    Payment Recipients (VWPR Youth) customers only. For more
    information, see Exclusions for automatically triggered Vulnerable
    Welfare Payment Recipients (VWPR Youth) Income Management for
