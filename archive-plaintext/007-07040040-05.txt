| 1                                 | Example 1                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Child Services have placed Amanda |
|                                   | in foster care with Jenny for 3   |
|                                   | months. Amanda's father's         |
|                                   | whereabouts are unknown and       |
|                                   | Amanda's mother is undergoing     |
|                                   | in-patient treatment at a clinic. |
|                                   | Jenny can claim FTB for Amanda as |
|                                   | legal responsibility of Amanda    |
|                                   | has been transferred under        |
|                                   | section 22(2) of the A New Tax    |
|                                   | System (Family Assistance) Act    |
|                                   | 1999.                             |

| 2                                 | Example 2                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Karen has 2 young children. One   |
|                                   | of the children has a severe      |
|                                   | disability. Respite foster care   |
|                                   | has been arranged for the child   |
|                                   | for a period of 3 weeks so Karen  |
|                                   | can spend extra time with the     |
|                                   | other child and have a break from |
|                                   | intensive caring                  |
|                                   | responsibilities. Karen continues |
|                                   | to be eligible for FTB as legal   |
|                                   | responsibility is retained for    |
|                                   | both children as the change in    |
|                                   | care is temporary due to          |
|                                   | requesting a break/support.       |

|                                   | Billy has been placed in the care |
|                                   | of Jane, a foster carer, by the   |
|                                   | local welfare agency/state        |
|                                   | authority. Jane lodges a claim    |
|                                   | for FTB for Billy. As part of     |
|                                   | Jane's claim, a letter is         |
|                                   | provided from the welfare         |
|                                   | agency/state authority confirming |
|                                   | there has been a formal change in |
|                                   | care of Billy and the court has   |
|                                   | placed Billy in care of the       |
|                                   | Minister. The letter outlines     |
|                                   | that Billy has been placed in     |
|                                   | Jane's care by the welfare        |
|                                   | agency/state authority under a    |
|                                   | foster care arrangement and       |
|                                   | advises the date this occurred.   |
|                                   | If the Service Officer is         |
|                                   | satisfied based on the letter     |
|                                   | that a change of care has         |
|                                   | occurred, no further evidence     |
|                                   | should be required. As legal      |
|                                   | responsibility for Billy has been |
|                                   | transferred to Jane, Jane will    |
|                                   | receive FTB for Billy.            |
