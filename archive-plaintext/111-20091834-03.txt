to enable a better interaction with them.

Alerts assist by showing:

if the customer has any issues present on their issues screen

if the customer's payment is currently suspended or recently cancelled

the date of an upcoming or missed appointment

the status of a customer claim and when it was submitted

if the customer is due to report or has missed their reporting day

if the customer has a debt and if any debt arrangements are due to
expire

Smart IVR Cards information

Table 6. Smart IVR cards show Service officers what happened before the
customer reached them, that is:

-   personalised messages given to the customer, or
-   tasks they were asked to action

This saves the Service Officer:

repeating messages to the customer, or

asking them about activities they have already done, for example:

-   Update Phone number
-   Confirm Family Assistance Income estimate

This also help the Service Officer decide if any more checks are needed.

Cards information

Table 7. Most information on Customer Overview displays as cards. Cards
show the interactions between a customer and the agency in date order
for the last 28 days. (With the exception of SMS and push notifications
which display for only 7 days.) Cards aggregate for the same activity
type done on the same day.

Cards highlight the customer journey to date by showing:

letters and other correspondence the customer has received from the
agency. Letters can be viewed as the customer sees them (PDFs)

the interactions the customer has had in the Smart IVR before reaching a
Service Officer. This saves the Service Officer from repeating messages
or completing activities the customer has already done or attempted to
self-serve

the previous interactions the customer has had with the agency, such as:

Service Centre visit

online and app activities

phone calls and push notifications

Cards information

Table 6. Most information on Customer Overview displays as cards. Cards
show the interactions between a customer and the agency in date order
for the last 28 days. (With the exception of SMS and push notifications
which show for only 7 days.) Cards aggregate for the same activity type
on the same day.

Cards help Service Officers by:

showing letters and other correspondence the customer has received from
the agency and a view of the letter as the customer sees it (PDF)

highlighting the journey the customer has already been on with the
agency, such as Service Centre visit, online and app activities, phone
calls and push notifications
