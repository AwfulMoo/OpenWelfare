This document outlines information about a notice of reimbursement
arrangement for Medicare Compensation Recovery.

Notice of reimbursement arrangements (NORA)

A reimbursement arrangement is:

-   an agreement in writing
-   an order by a court or compensation authority, or
-   a decision by a person or representative body that the notifiable
    person is liable to pay for related medical services and care costs
    as they are incurred

A reimbursement arrangement does not include payments where there has
been a fixed amount awarded for damages exceeding $5,000.

When a reimbursement arrangement is notifiable

Under section 13 of the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act
1995 (HOSC Act,) a compensation payer or their representative must
advise the agency:

-   if 6 months has elapsed from the date the claim was made by the
    injured person to the date the reimbursement arrangement is made
-   within 28 days after the arrangement was made, and
-   on the Notice of reimbursement arrangement form (MO027), or
-   in writing

See Notifiable and not notifiable claims.

When a reimbursement arrangement is not notifiable

If the reimbursement arrangement is made within 6 months of the date the
claim is made by the injured person, the claim is not notifiable.

A You do not need to tell us about the reimbursement arrangement (Z2797)
letter will be issued advising:

-   the claim is not notifiable
-   any payment will be returned, and
-   details of how to obtain a Medicare claims history

If a bulk payment agreement (BPA) exists, do not register the claim in
MCRS. Escalate to Programme Management. The BPA specified amount will be
payable instead of a notice to charge. See Payments, refunds and debts
for information about how to assess if a BPA applies to claim.

    arrangement and supporting documentation

Notification of reimbursement arrangement

The compensation payer is encouraged to use the agency’s current Notice
of reimbursement arrangement form (MO027). Alternatively, notice may be
given to the agency in any other form or letter provided all required
information is supplied.

See Resources for a link to the MO027 form.

The notice of reimbursement arrangement must include the below
information:

-   injured person's name, address and date of birth
-   date of injury or illness
-   nature of the injury or illness the injured person suffered (for
    example, broken arm)
-   compensation payer’s name and address details
-   date the claim was lodged
-   date the reimbursement arrangement was made
-   full name and signature of the compensation payer or compensation
    payer’s solicitor or agent

Where the date of lodgement of the claim and/or date the reimbursement
arrangement is missing from the notice, these can be obtained:

-   by telephone (or an email or letter), and
-   from the compensation payer, agent or their solicitor

All other information must be supplied in writing for the notice to be
considered valid.

The document will be considered valid and complete when some of the
information listed above has not been provided on the notice or form but
can be obtained from supporting documentation such as:

-   appeal decision documents e.g. Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT)
    determination
-   complying agreement
-   tribunal document e.g. certificate of determination

Where there is missing or incomplete information on the MO027, issue a
missing information letter. See Process correspondence for more
information on forms and to issue the correct letter.

Failure to give notice within 28 days

Under section 29(4) of the HOSC Act, if a valid NORA is not received by
the agency within 28 days after the arrangement was made, the
compensation payer is liable to repay any debts identified in the Notice
of charge. MCRS will issue a Compensation payer has not complied with
legislated notice requirements (Z2809) letter to the compensation payer.

Amount to be recovered

If a reimbursement arrangement is made, the agency recovers all Medicare
benefits and care costs that relate to the injury:

-   before the reimbursement arrangement starts, if more than 6 months
    have passed since the compensation claim was made
-   from the date of injury/illness, to the date the reimbursement
    arrangement is made
-   if the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) or other tribunal,
    determine medical expenses and care costs must be reimbursed to the
    injured person and impose a specified liability period
-   if all or part of the medical expenses have not already been
    reimbursed to the injured person

Note: the agency does not need to be notified of any ongoing medical
costs once the arrangement is made, as the compensation payer is
responsible for paying these costs.

Reimbursement of care costs

If a reimbursement arrangement is made, the injured person is
responsible for paying the care costs if:

-   they had nursing home care, residential care or home care provided,
    and
-   the care costs were paid to the injured person

If a reimbursement arrangement is made, that includes residential,
nursing home or home care costs, these costs are not payable to the
agency if:

-   residential care costs (all or part) have already been reimbursed
    before a claim for the residential care was submitted
-   home care expenses (all or part) have already been reimbursed before
    a claim for home care was submitted

After judgment or settlement

Where care costs have been provided, and a claim has reached judgment or
settlement:

-   If the injured person has already been reimbursed for these care
    costs, they are liable to pay the agency the amount of these costs
-   A reduced amount is payable if there is an apportionment of
    liability between the compensation payer and injured person

If past care costs are a component of the judgment/settlement amount,
the amount owed to the agency is taken to be the past care costs. For
example, if care costs exceed that amount indicated on the
judgment/settlement, the agency will only recover up to the amount of
compensation paid.

Note: customers only receive a refund if the agency receives more than
the amount identified to be recovered.

Notice of charge

If a valid notice of past benefits exists when the reimbursement
arrangement is made, this becomes the notice of charge.

If there is no valid notice of charge when the reimbursement arrangement
is made, a notice to claimant is issued to the injured person upon
receipt of documentation.

A notice of charge must be:

issued within 3 months of receiving a valid notice of reimbursement
arrangement , or

if an extension of time has been granted for the injured person to
return the notice to claimant:

-   within 60 days of receiving a complete and valid notice to claimant,
    or
-   within 60 days of the due date of the notice to claimant, where it
    was not returned, whichever is later

The notice of charge is payable within 28 days.

If the agency fails to issue a notice of charge within the timeframe the
right to recover any amounts owing is waived. The agency issues a ‘past
benefits and subsidies will not be recovered’ letter (Z2812).

Appeal of decisions

Claims initially accepted within 6 months can become notifiable. That
is, if there are subsequent periods of denied liability that are
successfully appealed.

A reimbursement arrangement made because of a successful appeal
decision, is notifiable if the appeal decision that reinstates liability
is:

-   6 months or more,
-   after the date the claim for compensation was made

Costs are now recoverable for periods of previously disputed liability,
which are now ruled as accepted periods of liability on an appeal
decision.
