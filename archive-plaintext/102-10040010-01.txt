This document outlines the procedure used to restore payments which have
been suspended due to failure to provide bank account details.

Bank details not recorded

If a claim is granted without recording a bank account for direct credit
of payments, the grant letter will include text advising the customer
they must provide bank account details by a certain date. This date will
be 28 days from the date of determination or date of commencement,
whichever is the later, plus an allowance for reasonable postage of
seven days (14 days if they live in a remote area or overseas).

A customer may be granted an exemption for a period of time or for a
particular reason and, when that time expires or the reason no longer
applies, they need to provide bank account details. A customer who
advises they no longer have a previously nominated bank account will
also need to provide new bank details. Failure to do so will result in
automatic suspension of the customer's payment.

13 week time-frame to provide bank details

If the customer supplies the required bank account details within 13
weeks of the suspension of payment, their payments may be restored.

If, however, it is outside this time-frame of 13 weeks and a bank
account has not been supplied, and/or an acceptable exemption has not
been recorded, the payment will be cancelled. Restoration of the payment
in this case is not an option. A new claim is required and bank account
details must be supplied.
