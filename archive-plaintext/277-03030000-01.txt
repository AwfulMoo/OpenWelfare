This document outlines the process when requesting customer information
from the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA). Child Support can ask
DVA for detailed information if they believe the customer is receiving a
DVA income/disability support pension or benefit. The information may
help update the customer’s income or explore avenues for collecting
debt.

How to make information requests to DVA

Make a direct request for information from DVA when it relates to:

-   determining the taxable or specified tax free pension or benefit
    component of a customer’s adjusted taxable income, or
-   determining if the customer receives 1 of the 6 DVA payments child
    support can collect from

The References page contains links to the Child Support Guide for
information about:

-   child support income, and
-   collection from veterans' pensions and allowances

The Process page explains how to issue a direct request.

For all other information requests, issue a notice under section 120 or
section 161 using the appropriate schedule. See Child Support's
information gathering powers.
