| 1                                 | How does Child Support find out   |
|                                   | who the Executor is so they can   |

|                                   | If the deceased person made a     |
|                                   | will, the person who contacts     |

|                                   | death may be able to advise us of |
|                                   | the Executor named in the will.   |
|                                   | If not other family members may   |
|                                   | be able to help.                  |

|                                   | or there is no Executor because   |
|                                   | the person died intestate (with   |
|                                   | no will), you may become aware of |
|                                   | a person who has been appointed   |
|                                   | by the Court as the administrator |
|                                   | of the estate.                    |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The Court maintains a register of |
|                                   | executors and administrators who  |
|                                   | have been granted probate (the    |
