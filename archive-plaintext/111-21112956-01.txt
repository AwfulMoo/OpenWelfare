This document outlines the Quality On Line (QOL) and Quality Management
Application (QMA) dispute process in the Face to Face (F2F) Services
Division, including how staff can lodge a dispute.

The process is based on the QOL and QMA Dispute Escalation Policy.

Social Security and Welfare (SSW) Quality will manage disputes lodged by
F2F staff in Service Zones.

Timeframes

Disputes must be lodged within 30 days of the Quality Check being
completed, unless a staff member has been on leave. In these cases, the
dispute is lodged when the staff member returns.

Service Officer responsibility

Service Officers must:

Support their dispute with evidence:

-   Research the error and make sure the dispute is supported by a
    business process or policy
-   Operational Blueprint will be the most appropriate reference,
    however other nationally endorsed references (that were current at
    the time the check was done) may also be suitable (for example,
    NNU’s, Roxy)

Finalise all actions on customer’s record before lodging dispute:

-   Service Officers must complete all actions on the customer's record
    as a priority, before lodging a dispute
-   Service Officers must not HOLD or leave a NOT or STA activity on the
    customer's record pending the outcome of a dispute
-   If Service Officers are unsure of the correct action to take pending
    the outcome, discuss with Team Leader

Independent reviewer

A Service Support Officer (SSO) in the Virtual Technical Support Network
(VTSN) who has technical skill in the relevant benefit system will carry
out the independent review.

The Independent Reviewer will determine if the outcome of the dispute
is:

-   Upheld - agree with original check decision
-   Upheld for different reason - original checking decision is correct
    but for a different reason. For example, different error reason
-   Overturned - original decision overturned. That is, agree with
    dispute
