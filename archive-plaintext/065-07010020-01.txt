This document outlines what an Evidentiary Certificate is and how one is
issued to registered members of the Pension Bonus Scheme (PBS).

Evidentiary Certificate

An Evidentiary Certificate is a statement issued by Centrelink or
Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) which confirms a person's
membership of the PBS. A member of the scheme can request that
Centrelink provide an Evidentiary Certificate for a full or part year
bonus period. The member must provide sufficient evidence to satisfy the
delegate that they or their partner have met the work test, or that the
criteria for being a non-accruing member are correctly applied.

The Pension Bonus Scheme is closed to new registrations from 1 July
2014.

Using an Evidentiary Certificate

The Evidentiary Certificate can be used by the person when they claim
the bonus as proof that the work test has been met for the period
covered on the certificate.

An Evidentiary Certificate issued by Centrelink is accepted as proof of
having passed the work test for the period covered by DVA. Similarly, an
Evidentiary Certificate issued by DVA is regarded as proof of having met
the work test for the period covered by Centrelink.

Registered members should be encouraged to request Evidentiary
Certificates.
