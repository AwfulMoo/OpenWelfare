| 1                                 | Student does not quality for 25%  |
|                                   | concessional study load           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Jamie has a car accident which    |
|                                   | results in a broken leg, needing  |
|                                   | surgery and rehabilitation. Jamie |
|                                   | cannot continue full-time study   |
|                                   | for that semester. They drop down |
|                                   | to 2 subjects. They cannot        |
|                                   | qualify for the 25% concessional  |
|                                   | study load as they do not have a  |
|                                   | substantial disability. As they   |
|                                   | are still able to do some study,  |
|                                   | they do not quality for JobSeeker |
|                                   | Payment (JSP). Jamie may still be |
|                                   | able to get Austudy as if they    |
|                                   | were a full-time student because: |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   they have a reasonable excuse |
|                                   |     for not undertaking full-time |
|                                   |     study, and                    |
|                                   | -   they intend to return to      |
|                                   |     full-time study in the        |
|                                   |     following semester            |

|                                   | concessional study load           |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Ella will be reducing their study |
|                                   | load to 0.250 EFTSL in the next   |
|                                   | study period. They can no longer  |
|                                   | study full-time because of a      |
|                                   | major flare up in their epilepsy. |
|                                   | Their medical practitioner (who   |
|                                   | has a detailed knowledge of       |
|                                   | Ella's physical conditions)       |
|                                   | provides a medical certificate.   |
|                                   | The medical certificate states    |
|                                   | Ella:                             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   has a substantial physical    |
|                                   |     disability, and               |
|                                   | -   they cannot successfully do   |
|                                   |     the normal amount of          |
|                                   |     full-time study in their      |
|                                   |     course because of their       |
|                                   |     disability                    |

|                                   | The Service Officer can grant a   |
|                                   | 25% concessional study load. This |
|                                   | is because of Ella's substantial  |
|                                   | physical disability and:          |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   they are enrolled and         |
|                                   | -   doing at least 25% of the     |
|                                   |     normal full time study load   |
