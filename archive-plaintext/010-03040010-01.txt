This document outlines when Basic Boarding Allowance (BA) and Additional
Boarding Allowance (ABA) can be paid under the Assistance for Isolated
Children (AIC) Scheme for students who need to live away from home to
undertake approved study.

General eligibility

General AIC eligibility criteria must be met for the applicant and
student.

BA is payable for eligible students who need to live away from the
principal family home in an approved board arrangement during school
term to have daily access to appropriate schooling.

If a student needs to board for short periods during the year, for
example, to undertaking diagnostic testing and/or receive support for a
learning disability, or when access from the principal family home to
the school is cut off due to special weather conditions, short-term BA
is available.

BA is payable for eligible students living in a special institution
catering for students with disabilities or health-related conditions
where they are residing there for a period of at least 20 continuous
school days.

BA is not payable for students who have been formally placed in
full-time residential care at a special institution by a state/territory
authority which provides foster care allowance to the institution for
the upkeep of the student.

DSP and PPS customers

If the student receives Disability Support Pension (DSP) or Parenting
Payment Single (PPS), and is undertaking primary or equivalent ungraded
study and qualifies for BA, AIC Pensioner Education Supplement (PES) is
the appropriate payment.

Rate of Boarding Allowance

Maximum rate Boarding Allowance (BA) is payable for students boarding
full-time - at least 4 nights per week. Otherwise, the rate is based on
the number of nights per week boarding, or the short-term boarding
period.

Additional Boarding Allowance (ABA)

ABA is the only AIC allowance that is means tested. It is payable for
students:

-   who qualify for BA
-   whose parental income complies with the Parental Means Test
-   whose annual boarding costs (made up of the actual boarding charges
    plus $250 for incidentals) exceed the maximum annual Basic Boarding
    Allowance rate

Students impacted by COVID-19

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some students may have been unable to
return to board for Term 2, 3 or 4 of 2020 or Term 3 or 4 of 2021 or
Term 1 or 2 of 2022.

Continuing Students with no change to board provider

Continuing students remain eligible for AIC BA and ABA in Term 2, 3 and
4 of 2020 or Term 3 and 4 of 2021 or Term 1 and 2 of 2022, where:

-   they were impacted by COVID-19
-   they were approved for boarding entitlements in the term immediately
    prior to the impacted term
-   their board provider holds a boarding place for them in the impacted
    term
-   the student intends to return to board as soon as possible, and
-   the school/board provider continues to support the student study
    remotely using other methods, such as online

Continuing students accepted at a new board provider

Continuing students accepted at a new boarding provider for Term 2, 3
and 4 of 2020 or Term 3 and 4 of 2021 or Term 1 and 2 of 2022, will only
be eligible for AIC BA and ABA where they were accepted by the new board
provider before the first day of the relevant term.

Continuing students who have changed board providers before the first
day of the relevant term, remain eligible for AIC BA and ABA in Term 2,
3 and 4 of 2020 or Term 3 and 4 of 2021 or Term 1 and 2 of 2022, where:

-   they were impacted by COVID-19
-   they were approved for boarding entitlements in the term immediately
    prior to the impacted term
-   their board provider holds a boarding place for them in the impacted
    term
-   the student intends to return to board as soon as possible, and
-   the school/board provider continues to support the student study
    remotely using other methods, such as online

Students who changed board providers after the first day of the relevant
term, will only be eligible once they physically present at the new
boarding provider.

New Claims

In Term 2, 3 or 4 of 2020 or Term 3 or 4 of 2021, new students are only
eligible for BA and ABA in the term in which they commenced with the new
provider, once they physically attend at the boarding provider. This
applies where the:

-   student was only accepted at a new boarding provider after the start
    of the impacted term, that is either Term 2, 3 or 4 of 2020 or Term
    3 or 4 of 2021
-   a new BA or ABA claim granted from 1 April 2020 for Term 2, 1 July
    2020 for Term 3 or 1 October 2020 for Term 4, or
-   a new BA or ABA claim granted from 1 July 2021 for Term 3 or 1
    October 2021 for Term 4

In Term 1 or 2 of 2022, new students are only eligible for BA and ABA
where the student's enrolment was finalised before the first day of the
relevant term.

New students who met the above for Term 2, 3 or 4 of 2020 or Term 3 or 4
of 2021 or Term 1 or 2 of 2022 are eligible to for BA and ABA where:

-   they were impacted by COVID-19
-   the student satisfies eligibility criteria for Basic Boarding
    Allowance, and where applicable Additional Boarding Allowance
-   the student is enrolled to commence boarding in the current term
-   their board provider holds a boarding place for them in the impacted
    term
-   the student intends to return to board as soon as possible, and
-   the school/board provider continues to support the student study
    remotely using other methods, such as online

Students unable to begin away from home, face to face studies at the
start of the relevant term not covered in the above, due to COVID-19
impacts, may remain eligible once the applicant/student provides
evidence.

Students with COVID-19 impacts will be eligible to be paid once:

-   COVID-19 impacts are confirmed, and
-   the student begins study on campus

Evidence can include one of the following:

-   A letter from the board provider or advice from the education
    provider website confirming reduced capacity at boarding place
-   A medical practitioner confirming health related impacts. For
    example, an autoimmune disorder
-   State or territory education department websites confirming school
    closures, or
-   State or territory websites confirming travel restrictions

For all other AIC claims, a student will only qualify for BA and ABA
once the student physically attends the boarding provider during the
relevant term.

There is no change for students who continued to board and study in
person.
