Agreements and arrangements

Services Australia relationships with other government departments are
bound by a high-level multilateral strategic partnership document as
well detailed Bilateral Management Arrangements (BMA) between Services
Australia and individual departments.

BMAs specify Commonwealth services provided by Services Australia and
conditions applying to the provision of those services. They improve
assurance arrangements to provide greater transparency over Services
Australia performance in meeting service delivery outcomes, risk
management and accuracy targets.

See Department of Social Services (DSS) Relationship Team.
