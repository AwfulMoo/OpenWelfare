This document outlines Alignment of Care processing for Family Tax
Benefit (FTB) lump sum claims for the 2010-11 financial year onwards for
customers who advise they have a child support assessment. Under the
Alignment of Care initiative, mutual customers of Centrelink and Child
Support can advise either program of their care arrangements for the
assessment to be completed and details transferred electronically to the
other program.

FTB lump sum claims for 2010-11 onwards

If the customer advises on the online or paper claim that they have a
Child Support assessment and:

-   the date of the Child Support assessment was before 1 July 2010, a
    care assessment will need to be completed by Centrelink as there
    will be no Child Support assessment in place from 1 July 2010
-   they are claiming FTB for a period in the financial year before the
    date of the Child Support assessment, a care assessment will need to
    be completed by Centrelink for this gap period. A request for care
    data from Child Support is sent upon completion of the lump sum
    claim activity. The status of the lump sum claim will remain pending
    until Child Support data is received, which will generally take 3 to
    5 days. Once this data is received, the care assessment for the gap
    period will be automatically updated and FTB entitlement assessed

If required, the Centrelink care assessment is completed using care
information and/or evidence supplied by the customer within their claim.
