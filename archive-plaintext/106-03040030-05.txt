+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 1                                 | An incorrect claim for a          |
|                                   | Department of Veterans' Affairs   |
|                                   | (DVA) payment                     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Roger attends a new claim         |
|                                   | appointment with a completed      |
|                                   | claim for Age Pension and it      |
|                                   | seems that he is eligible for     |
|                                   | payment. During his interview,    |
|                                   | Roger mentions that he recently   |
|                                   | lodged a claim with the DVA for a |
|                                   | Service Pension, but was          |
|                                   | rejected.                         |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Roger should be asked to provide  |
|                                   | the details of his claim with DVA |
|                                   | in the form of a letter           |
|                                   | confirming the date he claimed    |
|                                   | and the reason why the claim was  |
|                                   | rejected. If his claim was        |
|                                   | rejected because he was not       |
|                                   | qualified, it can be treated as   |
|                                   | an incorrect claim. Therefore,    |
|                                   | his claim for Age Pension may be  |
|                                   | backdated to the day he claimed a |
|                                   | Service Pension.                  |
