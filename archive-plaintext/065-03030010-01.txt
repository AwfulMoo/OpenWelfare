This document outlines how to process transfers to Age Pension when the
customer has completed the transfer online, via Assisted Customer Claim
(ACC) or lodged a Transfer to Age Pension (SA383) form.

Eligible customers

Transfer to Age Pension is available from 13 weeks before the customer
reaches Age Pension age. Eligible customers are invited to submit the []
online transfer to Age Pension or return the SA383 form depending on
their channel choice.

If the customer does not submit the transfer online, via ACC or return
the completed SA383, their payment may be suspended or cancelled from
the date they turn Age Pension age.

Identified Indigenous customers may be eligible for an automatic
transfer. However, if they submit a transfer online, ACC or lodge an
SA383 it must be processed. Remind customers of their notification
requirements, including advice that any money invested in superannuation
is assessable as financial investment from Age Pension age. See
Assessing superannuation.

For more information about this process, see Transfer to Age Pension.

Straight through processing

Straight through processing is where a claim for a social security
payment or service is assessed using criteria to identify if it is
suitable for an automated grant outcome.

Some online transfers do not need Service Officer intervention and will
automatically complete once submitted by the customer. Straight through
processing may occur where the transfer is straightforward. For example:

-   there are no updates needed
-   no documentation to be provided, and
-   no adverse impacts on the entitlements of the customer (or their
    partner)

Where transfers to Age Pension cannot auto complete, the status of the
activity will change to In Process and be assigned to a Service Officer
for manual processing.

If a claim meets the criteria for automated assessment, DOCs or Display
Notes on the customer's record will show that ROXY has created these.

Customer contact

If the claim was incorrectly granted, give feedback via ROXY.

Processing transfers

If the customer indicates in the online transfer or the SA383 that they
want to stay on their current payment, check if this will disadvantage
the customer. See Resources for Age Pension versus current payment.

If a Service Officer determines the customer would be significantly
disadvantaged, contact the customer to discuss if they should stay on
their current payment.

Blind customers

Customers currently receiving most social security payments including
Age Pension can be transferred to Age Pension (Blind) when:

-   they meet all the qualification criteria for Age Pension, and
-   the social security definition of permanent blindness

See Qualification for Age Pension (Blind) and Assessing Age Pension
(Blind) claims.

Backdating provisions

If an online, ACC, SA383 form or full Age Pension claim is lodged after
becoming qualified for Age Pension and the transfer provisions apply,
the date of effect may be backdated up to the later of:

-   13 weeks before the date of the decision to transfer
-   the date the person qualified for Age Pension

The References page contains more information on backdating provisions
(section 12, deemed claim in certain cases).

Employment income

When an income support customer reaches Age Pension age, they are no
longer entitled to receive the benefits of the Working Credit
initiatives.

If they receive a pension, they may be entitled to the Work Bonus.
Customers paid under the transitional rules are not entitled to the Work
Bonus, but the Work Bonus will still be used in the comparison
calculations and partners may still benefit by the reduction in total
income.

Residence checks

The Service Officer must also check that the customer satisfies the
residence assessment requirements for Age Pension. If any further forms
or modules are required, send them to the customer.

If a customer will satisfy the Age Pension 10 years qualifying residence
period within either 13 weeks of turning Age Pension age or submitting
the claim, do not reject their application to transfer.

Deceased customers

System generated grant and rejection letters for deceased customers:

-   are not addressed correctly, and
-   contain text that is inappropriate to send to a deceased estate

Staff must:

inhibit system generated letters

address grant or rejection letters to:

-   the 'Executor of the Estate' (if applicable), or
-   to the 'Estate of the Late <customer's name>'

The Resources page contains an example of appropriate letters to send.

Urgent transfers to Age Pension

Ensure customers who will soon lose qualification of their existing
payment (for example JobSeeker Payment (JSP)) are processed as a
priority and at the earliest touch point to avoid placing the customer
in financial hardship.

If staff are unable or not skilled to process Transfer to Age Pension
and urgent processing is needed create a Fast Note.

-   For ACC, select Auto Text > Older Australians > Claims > Age
    Transfer Online Urgent processing request
-   For SA383, select Auto Text > Older Australians > Claims > Age
    Transfer SA383 Urgent processing request

Leave the Fast Note DOC open. This makes sure the transfer is correctly
prioritised for allocation.

The Resources page contains:

-   information on the advantages of transferring to Age Pension versus
    staying on the customer's current payment
-   a link to mySupport, and
-   example text for manual letters for a deceased customer
