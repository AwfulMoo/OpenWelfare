For Integrated Care staff only.

This procedure contains instruction for WA Ex-nuptial child support
cases only.

This document outlines the process for Integrated Care Service Officers
in making and giving effect to decisions when Services Australia is
notified of a care change for a child. Links on this page may be
unavailable to external audiences.

Integrated Care

Integrated Care manages care changes for customers across the Child
Support and Centrelink Programs.

For the Child Support Program, Integrated Care manages:

-   Child Support referrals for disagreed care (where there is no
    pending registration)
-   Child Support referrals for disputed care where the date of event
    occurred prior to 23 May 2018 (old legislation)

For the Centrelink Program, Integrated Care manages:

-   Centrelink referrals for disagreed care (exception of new baby
    claims which are out of scope)
-   Centrelink referrals for disputed care where the date of event
    occurred prior to 23 May 2018 (old legislation)
-   Left care without consent

Integrated Care Service Officers provide customers with a case-managed
approach for care change notifications. Integrated Care Service Officers
assess the impacts of the care change on Family Assistance, Child Care,
Child Support, Income Support and Medicare Basics and ensure care is
accurately reflected in both the Child Support and Centrelink systems.
Customers are provided with the information and connections they need to
access services from relevant community support organisations and
government departments.

To assist with actioning a change in care notification, see Integrated
care - Notification and recording of change in care to access
care-related resources and tools.

Note: contact Operational Blueprint to obtain previous versions of PIs
relating to care.

make and give effect to a care determination

Customer Management in Integrated Care

Integrated Care Service Officers undertake work in both the Centrelink
and Child Support programmes, therefore their customer management
process includes:

-   the Child Support Customer Management Approach (CMA), where staff
    undertake Minimum Collection Activity and common activities until
    the care decision is made. See Common and specialised activities for
    Child Support staff
-   Completing Centrelink Business Imperatives within scope. The
    Resources page contains a link to the Business Imperatives homepage.

While on the phone with a customer, Service Officers will undertake the
above activities and any other items within scope. This would generally
not include Family Tax Benefit (FTB) new claims unless the customer is
experiencing financial hardship.

After Call Work can be used to finalise documentation, care decision
coding, and create intrays/activities for any post decision follow-up
required.

The Resources page contains links and resources to assist with
Integrated Care.
