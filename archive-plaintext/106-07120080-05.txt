|                                   | Penny has been married to Joshua  |
|                                   | for five years. Penny's           |
|                                   | relationship with Joshua is       |
|                                   | recognised under social security  |
|                                   | law due to the fact that they are |
|                                   | legally married. Penny and Joshua |
|                                   | are linked on the MS screen.      |

|                                   | Penny has recently commenced a    |
|                                   | new 'member of a couple'          |
|                                   | relationship with Mark whilst     |

|                                   | relationship with Joshua i.e.     |
|                                   | Penny has more than 1 partner.    |
|                                   | The agency does not recognise     |
|                                   | Penny's relationship with Mark    |
|                                   | because social security law does  |
|                                   | not recognise multiple            |
|                                   | relationships.                    |

|                                   | Section 4 of the Social Security  |
|                                   | Act 1991 appears to contemplate   |
|                                   | that a customer has 1 partner or  |
|                                   | none at all. The decision maker   |
|                                   | may therefore decide it would be  |
|                                   | appropriate to assess Mark as     |
|                                   | single under Section 24, taking   |
|                                   | into account unfairness or        |
|                                   | absurdities in the operation of   |
|                                   | the legislation. For example, the |
|                                   | legislation inferring that a      |
|                                   | customer has 1 partner or none at |
|                                   | all could be assessed as unfair   |
|                                   | to count 1 partner's income and   |
|                                   | assets against multiple partners, |
|                                   | for which the Act provides no     |
|                                   | clarity.                          |
