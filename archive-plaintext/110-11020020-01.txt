For Intelligence and Investigations Branch only.

This document outlines the process of deciding whether or not to refer
an Intelligence and Investigations Branch investigation to the
Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) for prosecution, and
subsequent processes related to the referral or non-referral.

Critical decision record

A critical decision record (CDR) must first be completed to support the
referral or non-referral decision, and this must be submitted for
approval by the Regional Investigations Operations Meeting (RIOM).

Referral of brief

Once a brief of evidence has been referred to the CDPP, they will advise
of their decision to accept or reject the referral.

In some cases, the CDPP may request that staff obtain further
information or evidence for criminal proceedings after a brief has been
referred. In these instances, staff must not use their coercive
information gathering powers.

Non-referral warning letter

For cases not referred for prosecution, consider whether a warning
letter should be sent to the customer. A letter should be sent if the
customer has been investigated for fraud and there is insufficient
evidence to justify a referral to the CDPP, but sufficient evidence of
dishonest behaviour. This promotes debt prevention and deterrence.

Investigation record

At each stage of the process, the investigation record must be updated
to reflect the current status of the referral or non-referral. Copies of
any letters issued to the customer are to be attached to the
investigation record.
