This document outlines information related to the Child Dental Benefits
Schedule (CDBS) in Medicare.

About CDBS

The CDBS is a dental benefits programme which covers part or the full
cost of some basic dental services for eligible children when the child
is:

-   eligible for Medicare
-   between 0 and 17 years old for at least one day that year, and
-   the child or the parent/guardian receive an eligible payment at
    least once a year

The parent/guardian can claim up to $1,052* for each child over 2
consecutive calendar years starting from their first eligible service.
They must remain eligible each year to receive the benefit.

*Amount is indexed annually, this is the CDBS cap amount for 2023.

For example:

A patient has their first service in 2022 (therefore, year 1 of their 2
year eligibility is 2022). Because the benefit cap amount in 2022 is
$1,026 this amount will apply across 2022 and 2023, assuming eligibility
is maintained in 2023.

If a patient had their first service in 2021 (therefore, year 1 of their
2 year eligibility in 2021) they will receive the 2021 benefit cap
amount of $1,013 which will apply across 2021 and 2022, assuming
eligibility is maintained in 2022.

The CDBS operates under the Dental Benefits Act 2008. The schedule of
services provided by the CDBS is established under this legislation.
