Multiple operations and EMSN benefit cap - Examples of when the EMSN benefit cap applies

Table 2: This table provides examples of when the EMSN benefit cap would
apply. Note: this table only applies where the EMSN benefit cap is less
than the 80% of OOP expenses.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------
  When processing a patient claim for a multiple operation where…   then the EMSN benefit cap…
  all items within the group have an EMSN benefit cap               applies to all items.
  not all items within the group have an EMSN benefit cap           does not apply to any items.

MSN when claiming consultation item 23 - Scenario 1

Table 3: This table provides an example of how to work out the Medicare
Safety Net benefit when claiming consultation item 23. Anne submits a
claim for a paid account for item 23.

  ----------------------------------------------------- ---------
  Component                                             Amount
  Schedule fee for item 23                              $36.30
  Medicare benefit for item 23 (100% of schedule fee)   $36.30
  Provider charged Anne                                 $200.00
  ----------------------------------------------------- ---------

Note: as Anne has reached the relevant threshold and is entitled to the
Medicare benefit plus the Medicare Safety Net benefit. Three components
need to be considered when working out the Medicare Safety Net benefit.
Anne will receive the lesser amount of the 3. See example below
(scenario 1) for Safety Net threshold reached for consultation item 23
to calculate Anne's Medicare safety net component.

Calculating the Medicare Safety Net threshold for consultation item 23 - Scenario 1 - 80% OOP, EMSN percentage cap, EMSN maximum cap

Table 4: This table provides an example of how to work out the Medicare
Safety Net benefit including calculating the EMSN capping.

| OOP x 80% =           | Schedule fee x 300% = |                       |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Calculation for Anne: | Calculation for Anne: | Maximum cap for item  |
|                       |                       | 23 is $500.00         |
| $200.00 - $36.30 =    | $36.30 x 300% =       |                       |
| $163.70               | $108.90               |                       |
|                       |                       |                       |
| $163.70 x 80% =       |                       |                       |
| $131.00               |                       |                       |
+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

Note: Anne's Medicare Safety Net benefit is the lesser of the 3 options
above which is $108.90. Anne would receive the Medicare benefit of
$36.30 + the EMSN percentage cap of $108.90 = total benefit of $145.20.

MSN when claiming consultation item 36 - Scenario 2

Table 5: This table provides an example of how to work out the Medicare
Safety Net benefit when claiming consultation item 36. Bob submits a
claim for a paid account for item 36.

  ----------------------------------------------------- ---------
  Component                                             Amount
  Schedule fee for item 36                              $70.30
  Medicare benefit for item 36 (100% of schedule fee)   $70.30
  Provider charged Bob                                  $150.00
  ----------------------------------------------------- ---------

Note: Bob has reached the relevant threshold and is entitled to the
Medicare benefit plus the Medicare Safety Net benefit. Three components
need to be considered when working out the Medicare Safety Net benefit,
and Bob will receive the lesser amount of the 3. See example (scenario
2) safety net threshold reached for consultation item 36.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

Note: Bob's Medicare Safety Net benefit is the lesser of the 3 options
above which is $63.80. Bob would receive the Medicare benefit of
$70.30 + 80% of the OOP which is $63.80 = total benefit of $134.10.

EMSN safety net benefit for non-consultation item 30071 - Scenario 1

  ------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------

Note: as the EMSN percentage cap amount is less than the 80% OOP, the
Medicare Safety Net benefit would be $62.70. Igor would receive the
Medicare benefit of $66.60 + the EMSN percentage cap of $62.70. Igor
would receive a total benefit of $129.30.

Note:

As the EMSN percentage cap amount is less than the 80% OOP, the Medicare
Safety Net benefit would be $159.00. Jill would receive the Medicare
benefit of $133.95 + the EMSN percentage cap of $159.00. Jill would
receive a total benefit of $292.95.

Basic Medicare Safety Net examples

-   Doctors charge for an item 23 $55.00
-   Medicare benefit $31.45
-   Patient OOP $23.55

The OOP expenses do not include costs for items such as the hire of
equipment (for example, crutches), medicines, bandages or travel
expenses incurred to attend a consultation etc.

Calculating Medicare Safety Net - example

-   Doctors charge for an item 23 $55.00*
-   Medicare benefit $31.45
-   Patient OOP $23.55
-   80% of OOP $18.85 Safety Net benefit (rounded up)

*The account has been fully paid.

The claimant will receive a total Medicare benefit of $31.45 + $18.85 =
$50.30, leaving them with a total OOP expense of $4.70 (20% of OOP
expense).

When the item is subject to an EMSN benefit cap of $10 instead of the
80% of OOP, the claimant will receive a total Medicare benefit of
$31.45 + $10 = $41.45, leaving them with a total OOP expense of $13.55.
