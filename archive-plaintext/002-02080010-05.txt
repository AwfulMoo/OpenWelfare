|                                   | Before cancelling a customer's    |
|                                   | payment, take care to establish   |
|                                   | that the customer has lost        |
|                                   | entitlement for that payment.     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | When an unfavourable decision is  |
|                                   | to be made, a Decision Maker (DM) |
|                                   | must explain to the customer the  |
|                                   | decision and give an opportunity  |
|                                   | to provide further information or |
|                                   | evidence relevant to the          |
|                                   | decision. The DM must also tell   |
|                                   | the customer of their review and  |
|                                   | appeal rights. This includes      |
|                                   | unfavourable decisions made by    |
|                                   | Service Officers within Smart     |

|                                   | If a DM is not speaking with a    |
|                                   | customer at the time of making a  |
|                                   | decision, they are required to    |
|                                   | make 2 genuine attempts to        |
|                                   | contact by phone before           |
|                                   | finalising an unfavourable        |
|                                   | decision.                         |
