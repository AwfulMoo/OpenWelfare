|                                   | constructive trust may exist:     |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | -   A customer (the parent) has a |
|                                   |     large block of land and has   |
|                                   |     built their own house. Their  |
|                                   |     child has also built their    |
|                                   |     own house and supplied all    |
|                                   |     the funds for its             |
|                                   |     construction. In such a case  |
|                                   |     the legal ownership is with   |
|                                   |     the parent but a constructive |
|                                   |     trust exists. Although the    |
|                                   |     parent 'legally' owns the     |
|                                   |     home as it is situated on the |
|                                   |     parent's property, the home   |
|                                   |     is 'beneficially' owned by    |
|                                   |     the child as the child has    |
|                                   |     made all the contributions.   |
|                                   |     The child is considered the   |
|                                   |     beneficial owner of their     |
|                                   |     house and the parent will not |
|                                   |     be assessed as owning this    |
|                                   |     asset                         |

|                                   | -   An Age Pension customer has   |
|                                   |     an adult child who intends to |
|                                   |     purchase and live in a home   |
|                                   |     property. They wish to borrow |
|                                   |     funds from a financial        |
|                                   |     institution but they require  |
|                                   |     the Age Pensioner to become a |
|                                   |     guarantor of the mortgage     |
|                                   |     loan the adult child takes    |
|                                   |     out. As part of the guarantor |
|                                   |     arrangements the financial    |
|                                   |     institution requires the name |
|                                   |     of the Age Pensioner to be    |
|                                   |     placed on the real estate     |
|                                   |     title and/or the mortgage     |
|                                   |     documents. However it is the  |
|                                   |     adult child who makes all the |
|                                   |     repayments on the mortgage    |
|                                   |     and occupies the home and     |
|                                   |     pays all the normal household |

|                                   |     Pensioner remains in their    |
|                                   |     own home. In such a case it   |
|                                   |     can usually be accepted that  |
|                                   |     a constructive trust is       |

|                                   | An example of an implied trust is |
|                                   | where a purchaser of property     |
|                                   | arranges for the ownership (legal |
|                                   | title) to be in the name of a     |
|                                   | third party. The third party in   |
|                                   | this situation will be presumed   |
|                                   | to be a trustee of the property   |
|                                   | for the purchaser.                |

|                                   | An example of a resulting trust:  |

|                                   | the property on trust for Harry   |
|                                   | until Harry attains the age of 25 |
|                                   | years but with no desire for      |
|                                   | Oliver to acquire the beneficial  |
|                                   | ownership. If Harry should die    |

|                                   | years, it would be Oliver's       |
|                                   | responsibility to re-convey the   |
|                                   | legal estate to Sandy or if Sandy |
