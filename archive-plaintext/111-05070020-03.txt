|                                   | Service Officer may have a        |
|                                   | customer on hold.                 |

|                                   | 5-10 minutes is the recommended   |
|                                   | guideline. As a general rule, if  |
|                                   | the TPS enquiry exceeds this time |
|                                   | TPS should take over the customer |
|                                   | enquiry. This frees the Service   |
|                                   | Officer to help the next          |
|                                   | customer. Use this as a guide     |
|                                   | only. Claim enquiries may extend  |
|                                   | this time if complex.             |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | If the TPS officer takes over the |
|                                   | enquiry, it is expected they will |
|                                   | complete the enquiry and notify   |
|                                   | the Service Officer of the        |
|                                   | resolution using the TSC. This is |
|                                   | unless there are system           |
|                                   | limitations or the enquiry is     |
|                                   | outside the scope of the TPS.     |
|                                   | This would be identified early    |
|                                   | and referred to a Service Support |
