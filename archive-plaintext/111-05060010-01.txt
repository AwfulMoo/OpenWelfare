This document outlines the Business Continuity Procedure when COLFrame
is unavailable.

When COLFrame is unavailable

COLFrame is a Centrelink middleware application that provides
functionality for Centrelink applications. These include Services
Australia Workspace and Interactive Voice Response (IVR).

Services Australia Workspace relies on COLFrame for screenpop data,
transfer lists, Line of Business (LOB) lists and auxiliary codes.

The following tasks may be affected as a result of COLFrame being
unavailable:

-   starting Services Australia Workspace
-   receiving screenpops
-   performing announced transfers
-   selecting LOB
-   performing unannounced transfers

Service Officers must follow the appropriate procedure when COLFrame is
unavailable in order to minimise the impact on customers.
