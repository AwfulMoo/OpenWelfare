Request for Replacement Medical Report - Carers

Follow the instructions below to create a Q888 letter.

The Operational Blueprint (OB) file Creating a Q999 or Q888 letter
111-14010060 has detailed information and instructions on how to create
a Q999 or Q888 letter.

Code the LDO screen with the listed option number listed below, then
copy and paste each individual row into the LDD screen, as follows:

1.  From the LDT screen, code ‘OPT’ in the command field, press Enter.
2.  Insert the relevant option numbers listed below into the LDO screen,
    press Enter.
3.  Code ‘DATA’ in the command field, press Enter.
4.  Copy and paste the approved text below in the relevant fields in the
    LDD screen, ensuring you have a space after the last word on each
    line. Each line has a 74 character limit and you must include a
    space at the end of each line to make sure that words do not join
    together in the letter.
5.  Use ‘next page’ to move to each paragraph (in Customer First).
6.  Code ‘draft’ in the command field, press Enter. Print a draft of the
    letter to check that the printed version is correct. The OB file
    contains instructions on how to do this.

Note: Only copy and paste text in to the specified paragraph. Do not add
any other text in any available lines for that paragraph text.
