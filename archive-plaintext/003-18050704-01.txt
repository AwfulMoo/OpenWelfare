This document outlines nominee arrangements for the National Redress
Scheme (the scheme) administered by the Department of Social Services
(DSS).

Nominees for the scheme

The scheme has a separate nominee process to Services Australia
programs. It is administered under specific legislation. There are two
types of redress nominees, an assistance nominee and a legal nominee.

An applicant can appoint a person or organisation who can help them to
apply for redress. Generally, a nominee can:

-   help a person apply for redress
-   receive copies of all letters
-   ask questions about the applicant’s application
-   receive phone calls about an applicant’s application
-   provide information to the Scheme, and / or
-   ask for an offer of redress to be reviewed.

Note: nominees appointed under the scheme must meet the same Identity
Confirmation requirements as applicants, see Identity Confirmation and
Alternative Identity requirements for the National Redress Scheme.

For an individual/person to confirm their identity a nominee must:

have a Confirmed identity status on their Centrelink record and provide
consent to use their Customer Reference Number (CRN), or

establish their identity by providing 1 document from each category
below:

-   Commencement of Identity document (CoI). A nominee can demonstrate
    CoI in Australia by providing documents that confirm their birth in
    Australia, or arrival in Australia, thereby establishing a nominee’s
    existence in Australia
-   Primary Use in Community document (PUiC)
-   Secondary Use In Community document (SUiC)

See Identity documents A to Z.

The Department of Social Security (DSS) will complete the process for
nominee organisations.

Nominees who have difficulty in obtaining sufficient identity documents
can undertake an alternative identity assessment, see Identity
Confirmation and Alternative Identity requirements for the National
Redress Scheme.

When applicants may appoint a nominee

An applicant may appoint a nominee if they:

-   want to apply for redress, but do not want to deal directly with the
    scheme themselves
-   want to apply for redress and want support through the process, for
    example to complete the Application for Redress
-   need support to deal with the scheme, for example help with
    providing the information required, or
-   have an existing legal arrangement where someone has the authority
    to act on their behalf

For more information about how to appoint a nominee see Nominees –
National Redress Scheme website.
