DFISA screens

Table 1. These screens are viewable by network all staff on a 'read
only' basis.

DFISA screens can be only be updated by authorised staff from the DVA
Clearance Team if it is necessary to code manual rates of DFISA due to
system limitations.

A transmission containing the new DFISA details is sent to DVA whenever
a DFISA screen is updated (both manually and automatically).

Calculation of DFISA Examples

How DFISA rates will display on DFS screen for reporting customers

Before 1 January 2022, DFISA payments for stimulus reporters were
calculated and transmitted to DVA when the customer reports their income
at the end of every entitlement period. DVA paid DFISA for the
entitlement period retrospectively. This is to ensure the correct amount
of DFISA was paid and to prevent overpayment.

A zero DFISA rate was then transmitted to DVA at the start of every
entitlement period. This occurred in the background. The DFISA Summary
(DFS) screen would show a provisional rate of DFISA, which is the rate
that would apply if the customer did not report any income.

Table 2: This table describes an example of the details displayed on the
DFISA Summary (DFS) screen for those reporting customers.

Calculating notional rent assistance

Table 4: This table provides an example of how to calculate a notional
rate of Rent Assistance (RA) using the DVA disability income rent test.

These amounts may not be current. They are examples only. For current
payments, see Rates and thresholds.
