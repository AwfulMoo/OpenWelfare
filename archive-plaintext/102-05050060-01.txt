This document outlines how to deal with the reporting of a change in
care details for a child or children, when the information is provided
by a third party and includes how to use the Report a Suspected Fraud
application.

Change in circumstances

Changes can be made to records where the person notifying the change in
child circumstances will be claiming Family Tax Benefit (FTB) for the
child or where the child is leaving the customer’s custody/care.

If the person notifying the change in circumstances will not be claiming
or losing FTB for the child, do not access the record. Transfer the
customer to the Centrelink 13 number Australian Government Services
Fraud Tip-Off Line or refer the customer to the [] online Reporting
fraud portal. If neither of these options is available, record the
information on the Report a Suspected Fraud application.

The Resources page contains a link to the Reporting fraud tool located
on the Services Australia Website and Fraud- welfare contact details.
