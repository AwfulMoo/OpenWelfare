Mutual obligation pause and resumption dates

These tables outline historical mutual obligation pause and resumption
dates in response to COVID-19 outbreaks.

Note: Job seeker compliance does not apply when mutual obligation
requirements are paused.

Before using this table, check if there are current Operational Messages
in place covering the failure date and location. Where there is no
current Operational Message for the failure date being reviewed,
continue to the process below.

How to use this table

Each state and territory has a separate table

The dates affecting some or all locations of the state or territory are
listed and are coordinated with paused and resumption dates

To find if mutual obligations were paused at the time of the failure:

-   Go to the table for the relevant state/territory
-   In the paused/resumed columns, find the period that covers the
    failure date
-   If the failure date is not covered by a paused period, the customer
    was subject to mutual obligation requirements
-   If the failure date is covered by one of the paused periods, check
    the LGA column to see if the job seeker's location was affected
-   where the job seeker's location was affected on the failure date,
    check the 'details' column for specific mutual obligation pause
    information
-   where the job seeker's location was not affected, the customer was
    subject to full mutual obligation requirements

Some locations were affected by multiple COVID-19 outbreaks. This means
that in these areas mutual obligation and job seeker compliance
arrangements will have multiple pause and resumption dates
