This document outlines how eServices staff action GDES reports for
failed electronic funds transfers (EFT) for provider and Department of
Veterans' Affairs (DVA) payments.

GDES reports

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) provides Services Australia with a
Government Direct Entry Services (GDES) report identifying Electronic
Funds Transfer (EFT) failures.

The Support, Telephony and Workload Management (STaWM) team in Services
Australia receives the Medicare GDES report from the RBA and forwards it
to the Vic eServices positional mailbox to action.

The Treasury section in Medicare Services Australia receives the DVA
GDES report from the RBA and forwards it to the Vic eServices positional
mailbox.

The GDES reports must be actioned daily to fulfil the Australian
National Audit Office (ANAO) requirement of no outstanding amounts over
90 days.

Report attachments

Medicare GDES

The email from STaWM contains a single pdf attachment, which is the
failed payment report. If there is an input processing report, it is
included within the email. Ensure this is not missed.

DVA GDES

The email from Treasury Medicare may contain multiple reports attached
as word documents. All reports must be actioned.

Write Back failed payments

It is an audit requirement that rejected payments are not outstanding
for longer than 90 days.

Failed Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) payments, which cannot be
redirected must be manually written back to the VAP Helpdesk.

Medicare failed payments are written back automatically.

The Resources page contains GDES rejection codes and useful source codes
to help with locating forms.
