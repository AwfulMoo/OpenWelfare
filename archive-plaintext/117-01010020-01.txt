This document outlines what a customer or their partner needs to do to
claim compensation.

Failure to claim compensation

Failure to take reasonable action to claim compensation can be a breach
of section 1166 of the Social Security Act 1991. It may result in the
customer, or their partner, having payments withheld. When they take
reasonable action their payments are granted or restarted.

Assessment and determination process

A customer cannot withdraw a claim. The claim must go through the entire
assessment and determination process. The compensation payer will decide
if the customer and/or their partner are eligible for a compensation
payment. If they refuse to accept those payments, their CAP can be
withheld.

Acceptable circumstances for not pursuing compensation

There are circumstances where it may be acceptable to not pursue a claim
for compensation. The delegation to determine if the customer must
pursue the claim lies at the APS5 or above.

The Resources page has descriptions about reasonable action to claim,
breach of S1166 and reasons for not pursuing compensation.
