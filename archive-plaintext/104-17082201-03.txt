|                                   | can represent a parent or carer   |
|                                   | as their authorised agent. Once   |

|                                   | Child Support will accept whoever |

|                                   | will deal with them as requested. |

|                                   | Support will refuse to deal with  |
|                                   | a representative and will         |
|                                   | recommend that the parent or      |
|                                   | carer choose someone else to      |
|                                   | assist them with their child      |
|                                   | support matters if the customer   |

|                                   | Child Support may request that an |

|                                   | An individual can represent a     |
|                                   | parent or carer as their          |
|                                   | authorised agent. Common examples |
|                                   | include a relative with power of  |
|                                   | attorney or a guardianship order  |
|                                   | or a lawyer who has been made an  |
|                                   | administrator. For example, a     |
|                                   | parent or carer may appoint a     |
|                                   | person to be their power of       |
|                                   | attorney if they are physically   |
|                                   | unable to manage their own        |
|                                   | affairs because they are          |
|                                   | hospitalised. A parent or carer   |
|                                   | may have several authorised       |
|                                   | agents who may or may not need to |
|                                   | agree on decisions, or who manage |
|                                   | different aspects of the parent   |
|                                   | or carer's affairs. It is         |
|                                   | important that the department     |
|                                   | have a clear understanding of the |
|                                   | extent of a person's authority to |
|                                   | act on behalf of a child support  |
|                                   | parent or carer.                  |

|                                   | An organisation can represent a   |
|                                   | parent or carer as their          |
|                                   | authorised agent. Child Support   |
|                                   | will treat any member of that     |
|                                   | organisation as a representative  |
|                                   | of the parent or carer. A common  |
|                                   | example is the Public Trustee.    |

|                                   | information on behalf of the      |
|                                   | parent or carer and conduct all   |
|                                   | of the parent or carer's business |
|                                   | with Child Support on their       |
|                                   | behalf. While they may confer     |
|                                   | with the child support parent or  |
|                                   | carer, they may not be legally    |
|                                   | required to unless specified in   |
|                                   | the document that provides the    |
|                                   | authority. An authorised agent    |

|                                   | support parent or carer and can   |
|                                   | do anything that the parent or    |
|                                   | carer could lawfully do           |
|                                   | themselves. This means an         |
|                                   | authorised agent can make legally |
|                                   | binding decisions on the parent   |

|                                   | deal with a parent or carer's     |

|                                   | be authorised to make a decision, |
|                                   | or they may need to all agree on  |

|                                   | should check the documentation to |
