This document outlines the process where a customer may request a
replacement cheque if their original cheque was not received, lost or
not presented. From 1 January 2016, Services Australia has removed
cheques as a payment option for Centrelink payments (except for
international customers).

Payment reissue

Cheque payments as a payment option for Centrelink payments ceased from
1 January 2016. Customers will only have had cheque payments made prior
to this date. When a customer asks for a replacement payment, if the
cheque is over 15 months old, see Cancelled and stale cheques below for
more details.

Cancelled and stale cheques

Cheques that have already been cancelled and are returned to Services
Australia by a customer must be disposed of securely by shredding or
placing in a secure disposal bin.

A stale cheque is a cheque that has not been presented and it has been
more than 15 months since its issue date. Stale cheques must be
presented at a Service Centre.
