Each program or initiative produces their own quality checking processes
to review the quality of the decision made, or information/payment
provided.

Government intent

The intent of the quality checking procedures is to:

-   give managers and checkers the tools to be able to identify
    strengths and weaknesses in business process, highlighting
    opportunities for continuous business improvement, using effective
    quality checking processes
-   make sure Quality Checkers have the same understanding and are
    completing the checks in a consistent manner by documenting the
    quality checking process

The procedures in this topic will assist staff to complete the quality
checks.

The Resources page contains links to various Quality policies and
information (including Quality Checking contacts) held on the intranet.
