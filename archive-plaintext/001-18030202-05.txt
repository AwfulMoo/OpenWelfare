|                                   | -   a second financial penalty    |
|                                   |     results in a loss of the full |
|                                   |     fortnight's payment, and      |
|                                   | -   a third financial penalty     |
|                                   |     results in payment            |
|                                   |     cancellation. Jack will then  |
|                                   |     need to reclaim a payment if  |
|                                   |     needed and will have to wait  |
|                                   |     4 weeks before receiving a    |
