This is a Family and Domestic Violence Interaction Point. If the
customer is with another person, on speaker phone, or already identified
with family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current
business conversation. Otherwise, go to the Family and domestic violence
procedure to conduct the risk identification and referral process.

If you have concerns about a child's safety, conduct the risk and
referral process.

This document outlines the Maintenance Action Test (MAT) codes and how
they are recorded and updated. The MAT code determines whether or not a
customer can be paid more than the base rate of Family Tax Benefit (FTB)
Part A for a child, if they are eligible.

MAT codes

According to the customer's circumstances, the appropriate procedure
should be used for the protocols and actions to be taken in each case,
for example, when the customer applies for a child support assessment.

The MAT code must be recorded for an FTB child to show that the customer
(or their current partner if they are the child's parent and the
customer is not):

-   has taken reasonable action to obtain child support
-   is not required to take action to obtain child support
-   has applied for or been granted a full or partial exemption from
    obtaining child support
-   has made an informed decision not to take the required action to
    obtain child support - FTB Part A will be limited to the base rate
    for the child
-   has failed to take the required action to obtain child support - FTB
    Part A will be limited to the base rate for the child

In some cases the maintenance action code is auto-updated by the system,
for example, after an automatic review or as a result of child support
entitlement data transferred from Child Support.

Note: some 'Parentage Unknown 'exemptions and 'Artificial Conception
Procedure' cases are assessed by Service Officers.
