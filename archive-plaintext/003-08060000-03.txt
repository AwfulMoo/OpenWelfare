Special Benefit categories

Identifying the correct category of SpB and applying it to the customer
is a very important aspect of SpB claim assessment. The SpB category
controls:

-   the maximum duration the customer may remain on payments
-   the maximum rate the customer can be paid
-   mutual obligation requirements

Holders of payments may be paid SpB even though they are not Australian
permanent residents.

For more information, see Special Benefit (SpB) categories.

|                                   | The primary purpose of the review |
|                                   | is to confirm the customer's      |
|                                   | ongoing entitlement to SpB. It    |
|                                   | should also be used as an         |
|                                   | opportunity to consider if the    |
|                                   | customer has become entitled to   |
|                                   | another income support payment.   |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | The customer (and partner, if     |
|                                   | applicable) must continue to meet |
|                                   | the hardship provisions of the    |
|                                   | payment. For their review, the    |
|                                   | customer (and partner) should     |
|                                   | provide bank statements for the   |
|                                   | last 13 weeks for all accounts,   |
|                                   | as well as all income and         |

|                                   | supporting documents to determine |
|                                   | if the customer still meets the   |
|                                   | hardship provisions of the        |
|                                   | payment.                          |
