About HPOS

HPOS is a secure, online single point of entry for healthcare
professionals, organisations and industry staff that enables access to a

Health professionals such as general practitioners, specialists, allied
health professionals, dentists, practice managers and practice staff,
are able to create new provider numbers immediately, update existing
bank account details, submit claims, view reports and verify patient
eligibility including patient care plan history. Health professionals
can also nominate delegates to undertake administrative tasks on their
behalf, for example, submitting online claims and checking MBS items
claiming eligibility.

Accessing the patient care plan history function in HPOS

About patient care plan history in HPOS

A care plan refers to MBS (Medicare Benefits Schedule) items covered
under:

-   GP Management Plans, Team Care Arrangements and Multidisciplinary
    Care Plans as indicated by Medicare items 721, 723, 725, 727, 729
    and 731

To view a patient's care plan history on HPOS the patient must:

-   be 18 years of age or older
-   be registered for Medicare (Consumer) Online Services
-   give verbal consent each time the care plan is viewed

Patients can monitor access to their care plan history through
Medicare’s (Consumer) Online Services and subsequently report any
unauthorised activity to Services Australia.

These measures align with Services Australia compliance with the Privacy
Act 1988, the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the Commonwealth Fraud and
Control Guidelines 2002 to establish and maintain fraud prevention,
detection, investigation, reporting and data collection procedures and
processes.

View a patient's care plan history

To view a patient's care plan history, the health professional must
confirm the patient's details using:

-   Medicare card number
-   individual reference number
-   first name

Upon successful confirmation of the patient, the health professional
must gain the patient's verbal consent (ticking a check box within the
system) before viewing the care plan history which includes:

-   date of service
-   item number
-   brief description of the item number, for example, item number
    00732 - Review a GP Management Plan or Coordinate a Review of Team
    Care Arrangements/Multidisciplinary Community Care Plan/Discharge
    Plan

Medical Certificates and Reports in HPOS

HPOS services are currently available for the following Services

Customers with an illness or injury which prevents them from working can
seek an exemption from

mutual obligation requirements or Participation Requirements by lodging
a medical certificate.

While paper Medical Certificates (SU415) are still accepted, the online
equivalent of the form SU683 is available for registered health
professionals as an alternative. When the health professional logs onto
the secure HPOS portal, the form pre-populates with their unique
provider details.

Upon successful submission to Services Australia, a started activity is
created in the customer's electronic record.

Medical Report - Disability Support Pension (SA434)

The Medical Report - Disability Support Pension is an online form health
professionals can lodge in place of its paper version, Medical Review –
Disability Support Pension (SA458 or SA012R). This Medical Report is
requested by Services Australia when a person’s eligibility for
Disability Support Pension is being reviewed. The report must not be
used by a health professional in instances where a customer is claiming
the Disability Support Pension. For more details, see Digital images of
medical reports electronically lodged by Treating Health Professionals
