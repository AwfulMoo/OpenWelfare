This document outlines the system process that checks if a Job Plan has
been negotiated for Centrelink managed job seekers.

Job Plan review timeframes

A Job Plan review will be automatically created for Centrelink managed
job seekers at the following times:

-   When a job seeker is granted an income support payment with mutual
    obligation requirements; or
-   At the end of any waiting periods a job seeker is serving after
    being granted an income support payment with mutual obligation
    requirements; or
-   The date a job seeker on Parenting Payment (Single) becomes subject
    to mutual obligation requirements; or
-   When the Job Plan has been sent to a job seeker's online account and
    they still do not have an approved Job Plan after four days

This review will mature in 14 calendar days. A request to contact letter
is issued advising the job seeker to contact Services Australia within
14 days to negotiate a Job Plan if the following circumstances apply on
day 14:

-   does not have a Job Plan
-   is not exempt from their mutual obligation requirements and
-   is not a Community Development Program (CDP) job seeker with a
    pending Plan

Note: this review process and subsequent suspension functionality does
not apply to provider managed job seekers.

Suspension of payment

Centrelink managed job seekers will be suspended if they have not
negotiated a Job Plan within 14 days of the date the request to contact
was sent. This effectively provides Service Officers and job seekers
with 28 days to agree to a Job Plan.

If the payment is suspended, a DOC will be recorded on the job seekers
record.

The payment suspension will be for failing to respond to correspondence.
This is restorable, but a Job Plan must be negotiated on restoration.

Job seekers are able to go online and restore their payment by
completing the outstanding 'agree to Job Plan' task in their online
account.

Failed online tasks will convert to a work item that will be allocated
to a Service Officer to contact the job seeker. Review notes on the job
seeker's record, to assist staff will be viewable in Process Direct or
Customer First.

Negotiating a Job Plan

Under the Services Australia and Department of Employment and Workplace
Relations (DEWR) Bilateral Management Arrangements (BMA), a Job Plan
should be negotiated for Centrelink managed job seekers within four days
of the job seeker receiving their first regular payment.

The Resources page contains a table on the notes available to Service
Officers when a job seeker completes online tasks but the result is not
successful and receipt messages returned to job seeker when actioning an
online task.
