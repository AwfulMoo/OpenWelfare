|                                   | Case 1- ‘K’ is owed $20,000 by    |
|                                   | ‘J’.                              |

|                                   | Case 2 – ‘J’ applies against ‘K’  |
|                                   | due to change of care.            |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Case 2 has an ongoing liability   |
|                                   | of $500 per month and no          |
|                                   | maintenance arrears. The          |
|                                   | customers agree all Case 2        |
|                                   | liability is to be offset against |
|                                   | the debt remaining on Case 1. An  |
|                                   | Ongoing Offset for 100% of the    |
|                                   | Case 2 liability should be        |
|                                   | entered. Each time the liability  |
|                                   | is raised on Case 2, the          |
|                                   | maintenance debt on Case 1 will   |
|                                   | be reduced by $500. The result of |
|                                   | this offset arrangement is that   |
|                                   | ‘K’ (the payer in Case 2) does    |
|                                   | not have to pay any maintenance   |
|                                   | to ‘J’ until the debt is paid     |
|                                   | off.                              |

|                                   | ‘F’.                              |

|                                   | Case 2 – ‘F’ is owed $1500 by     |
|                                   | ‘E’.                              |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Both cases are ended due to the   |
|                                   | child turning 18. A One-Off       |
|                                   | Offset is applied for the amount  |
|                                   | of $1500. The offset reduces the  |
|                                   | arrears on both cases by $1500.   |
|                                   | The Case 2 debt is cleared in     |
|                                   | full and the Case 1 debt is       |
|                                   | reduced to $3500.                 |

|                                   | Case 2 has an ongoing liability   |
|                                   | of $500 per month and is now in   |
|                                   | arrears by 1 month. The customers |
|                                   | agree to offset existing debt     |
|                                   | immediately and to offset 80% of  |
|                                   | future liabilities. A One-Off     |
|                                   | Offset of $500 and also an        |
|                                   | Ongoing Offset of 80% are         |
|                                   | applied. The Case 2 arrears of    |
|                                   | $500 is cleared and the Case 1    |
|                                   | arrears is reduced to $4500.      |
|                                   | Future liabilities raised on Case |
|                                   | 2 will be offset by 80% ($400).   |
|                                   | The remaining 20% ($100) remains  |
|                                   | payable.                          |
