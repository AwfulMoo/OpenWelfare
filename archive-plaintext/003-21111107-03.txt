This is a Family and Domestic Violence Interaction Point. If the
customer is with another person, on speaker phone, or already identified
with family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the current
business conversation. Otherwise, go to the Family and domestic violence
procedure to conduct the risk identification and referral process.

For the New South Wales Floods – July 2022, AGDRP and NZ DRP claims
cannot be rejected if a customer has claimed for a non-declared Local
Government Area (LGA) in New South Wales and meets all other eligibility
criteria. All other AGDRP and NZ DRP claims that do not meet the
eligibility criteria can be rejected. See the Process page.

For the New South Wales Floods - February 2022, 3 new Local Government
Areas (LGAs), Lake Macquarie, Strathfield and Waverley, were declared on
27 June 2022. Any claims previously rejected for these LGAs – customers
must lodge a new claim. Customers do not need to request an explanation
of the initial decision and these claims must not be re-indexed.

New impact reasons have been added to the online claim. Check the impact
reason selected by the customer. See Impact reasons to decide if the
customer meets the adversely affected criteria.

Reminder: more than one Flexible Support Payment (including AGDRP, NZ
DRP and the Pandemic Leave Disaster Payment) cannot be paid on the same
day.

This page has information to help staff process claims for AGDRP and NZ
DRP in Process Direct where the online claiming channel has been

Service Officers must not select an activity in Customer First when
Operational Blueprint advises claims are to be processed in Process
