This document outlines how to action a Restricted Update Record (RUR)
and is for Data Quality Unit (DQU), office code NA8 staff only.

RUR restrictions

An RUR record is one where update access has been restricted, usually
permanently. Unlike a Restricted Access record, information is still
visible to all users. Some automatic updates still occur on the record,
so these records are reviewed periodically.

RUR application

RUR is applied to:

-   a record which is extensively intertwined and the customer requires
    a new record
-   cases of Identity Fraud identified by the Intelligence and
    Investigations Branch

Only staff in the DQU can apply the restriction and, if required, allow
temporary access to staff. In some cases Service Officers from other
areas, may be granted permanent access, for example the Intelligence and
Investigations Branch.

For partnered customers, restriction and access to restricted records
must be applied to both records.

Service Officers requiring access to a restricted record should contact
the DQU Intertwined Team.

RUR identification

An RUR is identifiable on entry to the record by

-   a Display on Access (DOA) DOC, and
-   a warning W0003DI that updates to the record are restricted, with
    details of the users who can update the record and contact details
    for the DQU. [Enter] past this screen if only view access is
    required

Changes to access of restricted records take effect almost immediately
in production.
