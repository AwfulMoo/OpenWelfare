This document outlines details about raising debts where liability for
recovery of the debt is due to multiple parties.

Liability to repay a debt

Payment responsibility for debts raised under the Social Security Act
generally belongs to the customer who received the excess payment. This
occurs even if another person encouraged or gained a benefit from the
fraud.

However, for debts incurred on or after 1 January 1994:

-   if a person is liable to repay a debt under the Social Security Law
    and
-   another person is convicted of an offence in relation to that debt
    under sections 5, 7A or 86 of the Crimes Act 1914
-   the customer and the other person are jointly and severally liable
    to repay the debt

Raise these debts under section 1224AB of the Social Security Act 1991.

Prosecution

When investigating these debts, be aware:

prosecution is possible

the Director of Public Prosecutions decides whether or not to prosecute

any evidence gathered may assist in convicting a person involved in an
offence

if the court has made an order dividing the total debt between the
parties, for example:

-   Person A to repay $X and
-   Person B to repay $Y, once Person B's portion of the debt is paid
    (regardless of who pays it), Person B's liability ends

A co-debtor is a person involved in the primary debtor's action of
committing an offence against the Social Security Act 1991, to obtain
money. This is when both people are:

-   convicted of the offence/s committed and
-   liable to repay all or part of the account, as directed by the judge

The primary debtor is the customer against whom the account was first
raised. The co-debtor's account is a mirror image of the primary
debtor's account.
