Purpose of the Deduction Statement

-   the amounts deducted from the payment
-   the balance remaining

Encourage customers to get and check their statement. Customers can
track their deductions and make sure their financial arrangements are
correct.

[] Customers can also view and update some deductions via their
Centrelink online account.
