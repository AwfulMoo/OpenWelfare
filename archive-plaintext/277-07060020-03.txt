This page contains the process to manually reconcile an estimate of
income from 1 July 2011. Most reconciliations are automatically
performed by Cuba. If manual intervention is required as a result of an
exception to the auto reconciliation process, an intray will
automatically generate. This page also contains the processes to follow
in other specific circumstances. For example, a customer disputes the
reconciliation outcome.

On this page:

Manual intervention required for estimate reconciliation (Service
Officer)

Income Amount Order applied after estimate made in the financial year

WA Ex-nup indicator is identified and estimate was lodged before 3 March
2011

Post Separation Income (PSI) excluded during the financial year of the
estimate

Estimate with PSI exclusion applied, identified change to the assessment

Manual taxable income (ATO (MAN)) is loaded in Cuba

TRDB income is loaded in Cuba

Two ATO Taxable incomes are loaded in Cuba

Amended taxable income issued by the ATO

Centrelink or DVA non-taxable income received and estimate in that year
has previously been reconciled or set to Recon-No Change

New Centrelink or DVA non-taxable income received and estimate in that
year has previously been reconciled or set to Recon-No Change

Child Support Amended estimate during the financial year of the estimate

Deceased indicator - a parent, non-parent carer or child

Estimate results in a Fixed Annual Rate (FAR) and subsequent higher
income estimate results in an assessment less than FAR

Reconciliation using a determined Adjusted Taxable Income (ATI)

Insufficient information to determine an ATI

Estimate reconciled with determined ATI, actual income later received
from ATO

Manual intervention reconciling estimates for reverse cases

Finalising the manual reconciliation process

Customer disputes the reconciliation outcome
