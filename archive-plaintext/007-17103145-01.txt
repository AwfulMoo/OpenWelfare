This document outlines information about the roles and responsibilities

Approved child care services

The Department of Education, Skills and Employment is responsible for

Care Subsidy (CCS) and Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) are only
available to families using approved child care.

Approved child care services are responsible for:

-   providing child care for families
-   advising families about CCS and ACCS
-   receiving CCS and ACCS payments on behalf of families and apply this
    as a fee reduction. Receipts issued reflect the amount of CCS/ACCS
    received
-   submitting initial enrolment notices for new children entering their
    service with Services Australia (which customers are required to
    confirm, dispute or reject), and enrolment updates when
    circumstances change
-   reminding new families transferring to their service to advise
    Services Australia of their change in child care arrangements
-   identifying any children at risk of serious abuse and helping
    families access ACCS (Child Wellbeing)
-   submitting session reports (attendance details) for children
    attending their service
-   maintaining child care attendance records
-   advising child care details to the Department of Education, Skills
    and Employment
-   retaining any CCS related documents for three years and making them
    available to Services Australia or the Department of Education,
    Skills and Employment as required

Information submitted and received by child care services is via the
internet using the secure integrated Child Care Subsidy System (CCSS).
CCSS is accessible by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment
and Services Australia.

Child care services should refer to the Child Care Provider Handbook
produced by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment for
policy and procedural information.

If further advice is required, child care services should contact the
Department of Education, Skills and Employment CCS Helpdesk.

-   liaising with peak bodies within the child care industry
-   assessing applications from child care providers to become an
    approved child care service

-   accepting claims and documents from families
-   assisting families claim CCS and/or ACCS via digital and staff
    assisted channels
-   update customer details relating to CCS, including income estimates,
    activity details and changes in care

    care service

    accepting information or handing off as appropriate

    evidence provided and determining exceptional circumstances

Under no circumstances should Services Australia (including specialists

Multicultural Service Officers) have direct contact with child care
services.

It is not the responsibility of Services Australia to act as a liaison
point between customers and their providers as this would be considered
a breach of privacy. The only exception would be where staff in the
Additional Child Care Subsidy (ACCS) processing team are required to
contact the provider to advise of an ACCS (Child Wellbeing) application
adverse outcome.

Child care services have been informed of the correct channels to
escalate their enquiries through which is via the Department of
Education, Skills and Employment.

    customer’s CCS payment, the customer will need to contact Services
    Australia directly
-   For all other matters, staff (including specialist staff; Social
    Worker, Grandparent, Foster and Kinship Carer Advisers) should
