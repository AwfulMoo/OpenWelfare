Examples of revised release date

CrP-PRI where the revised release date is before or after the original release date

Table 9: This table outlines CrP-PRI payability (or not payable) when
the original planned released date has been revised by the correctional
centre.

Crisis Payment is payable if the revised release date is before the
original planned release date as long as the customer meets all other
eligibility criteria

Where the customer is released from prison later than originally
scheduled, for example, after the original release date, Crisis Payment
is not payable and becomes a recoverable debt

If the release date is revised by the prison and is after the originally
scheduled release date, and CrP-PRI has been paid, reverse the grant
decision. The customer has to repay the original payment and make
another claim for CrP-PRI
