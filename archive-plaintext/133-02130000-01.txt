Use of PRODA

PRODA allows secure access to government online services via a username,
password and verification code log on. PRODA is digital, portable, and
no additional hardware or software needs to be installed. Users can
change and manage their account details online in PRODA including
changing name or contact details.

PRODA will gradually be rolled out more broadly across Services
Australia's online systems, and will eventually replace some of the
agency's current log on methods.

For the agency, PRODA does not replace any of the following, users are
still required to log on with their current method:

-   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Site certificates. This includes
    Health Professionals Online Services (HPOS) and Midwife Professional
    Indemnity Scheme (MPIS) site certificates)
-   National Authentication Service for Health (NASH) PKI certificates
    for organisations
-   Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) log on only
-   Hearing Services eClaiming log on only
-   Australian Organ Donor Register (AODR)

Benefits of PRODA

-   users do not have to wait to receive CDs and authentication tokens
    (USBs/Smartcards)
-   users do not have to install additional software (and ongoing
    software updates)
-   the ability to use HPOS on a smartphone or tablet
-   users no longer have to keep a physical certificate safe
