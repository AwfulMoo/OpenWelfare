|                                   | the 18 September 2010. Sarah was  |

|                                   | institution on the 18 September   |

|                                   | If it is decided that the care    |
|                                   | receiver is not in the            |
|                                   | institution permanently then the  |
|                                   | date of event previously coded    |
|                                   | should be deleted. This should    |
|                                   | undo the 14 week adjustment       |
|                                   | period count. The Service Officer |
|                                   | will then treat the period in the |
|                                   | institution as TCC.               |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | Sarah entered the institution as  |
|                                   | an intended permanent placement   |
|                                   | on 10 September 2010. However, it |
|                                   | was decided later she should be   |
|                                   | there only temporarily. The       |
|                                   | Service Officer deletes the       |
|                                   | permanent entry date of event on  |
|                                   | the Care Receiver Care and        |

|                                   | and codes the temporary cessation |
|                                   | of care using the TCC workflow    |
|                                   | for the period the care receiver  |
|                                   | was in the institution. As Sarah  |
|                                   | will be remaining in the          |
|                                   | institution, further temporary    |
|                                   | cessation of care will be coded   |
