This document outlines the procedure to conduct reviews of independence
for ABSTUDY.

Independent status

ABSTUDY students and Australian Apprentices who are granted independent
status may be granted either permanent or reviewable independent status.
Reviewable independent status means the grounds for which independent
status was granted may change and therefore affect eligibility for
independent status.

Review reasons for independent status

The reviewable ABSTUDY independent status grant reasons include:

-   the customer is 16 years of age or older and living in a de facto
    relationship which is of at least six months in duration
-   the customer currently has the care or custody of another person's
    dependent child/student
-   the customer is 15 years of age or over and has parent(s) who cannot
    exercise their parental responsibilities
-   the customer is 16 years of age or over and living in an Indigenous
    Australian community after previously being adopted or fostered by a
    non-Indigenous family for more than two years, or
-   the customer is of minimum school leaving age or at least 16 years
    of age, and homeless (including customers in State care who are not
    living with a carer or receiving any ongoing support from the
    State/Territory)

Change in circumstances

A review of independent ABSTUDY status may occur due to a change in the
customer's circumstances. ABSTUDY customers granted under a reviewable
independence category do not have to reapply for independent status each
year, but may need to re-establish eligibility when their circumstances
change. They must notify Services Australia of a change in circumstances
within 14 days.

The change in circumstance that may affect independence would depend on
the reason for grant of independence. For a customer who has been
granted independent status because they are:

in a de facto relationship of at least six months the changes of
circumstances would be that:

-   the customer is no longer in a de facto relationship that has
    endured for at least six months

a customer who has the care or custody of another person's child and
that child is a dependent child for ABSTUDY purposes of the customer.
The changes of circumstances would be that:

-   the customer no longer has the care or custody of the other person's
    child, or
-   the child is no longer a dependent child of the customer
-   Note: if the customer has the care or custody of another person's
    child, but that child is a different child to the one they were
    caring for when they were granted independent status, the customer
    will need to reapply for independent status for the new child

15 years of age or over and their parent(s) cannot exercise their
parental responsibilities. The changes of circumstances would be that
the customer's parent(s):

-   have been released from prison, or
-   have been released from a psychiatric facility, or
-   have been released from a nursing home, or
-   were missing but have been located or made contact

16 years of age or over and living in an Indigenous Australian community
after previously being adopted or fostered by a non-Indigenous family
for more than two years. The change of circumstances would be that:

-   there is a change of address to a location other than the home
    community

of minimum school leaving age and a homeless customer. The changes of
circumstances would be that the customer has had:

-   support from either of their natural or adoptive parents, or
-   contact from either of their natural or adoptive parents
-   Note: care should be taken when reviewing a homeless customer. All
    reviews of independent status for homeless customers should be
    referred to a social worker who will determine the nature of the
    support/contact and whether the customer would still be regarded as
    homeless
