This document outlines new rules that were implemented from 1 January
2002, for the way private trusts and private companies are treated under
the income and assets tests. There are some concessions and exemptions
to the attribution of private trust and private company assets to
Centrelink customers.

Income and assets held by private companies and private trusts

Income and assets held by private companies and private trusts are
generally treated as belonging to the customer who controls the trust or
company. Concessions available include:

-   primary production concessions
-   savings provisions for some trusts
-   life interest concessions
-   concessions for genuine investors
-   pensions loan scheme
-   assets hardship provisions

Only the Complex Assessment Officer (CAO) has the delegation for making
the attribution decision and all cases must be referred to the CAO.

Different rules apply to an approved SDT

Different rules apply to an approved Special Disability Trust (SDT). A
SDT's income is exempt from the income test. The SDT's assets are exempt
from the assets test as long as the assets are not over the concessional
asset limit. Gifts to a SDT may be exempt from the deprivation
provisions if the contributor is an immediate family member, of Age
Pension age and the SDT concessional gifting cap is not exhausted.

-   the trust is a fixed (non-discretionary) trust set up before 7:30 pm
