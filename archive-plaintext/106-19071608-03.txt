Risks to a customer's privacy have been identified. See Separating
Safely - protecting personal details to make sure the customer's
personal details are safe before progressing.

This is a family and domestic violence interaction point. If the
customer is with another person, or on speaker phone, or already
identified with family and domestic violence concerns, continue with the
current business conversation. Otherwise, go to the family and domestic
violence procedure to conduct the risk identification and referral
process.
