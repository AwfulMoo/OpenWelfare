Helping customers

Giving customers information about additional assistance and linking
them to supports is an important part of service delivery.

There are many types of assistance available within and external to the
agency. The assistance provided by each service varies according to
their role, the type of service and the customer’s needs.

Consider if the agency can provide the support the customer needs before
linking them to an external support service.

For information about:

-   internal services, see Specialist officers and other internal
    supports for customers
-   external referral options, see Referral to external support services
    or the Payment and Service Finder
