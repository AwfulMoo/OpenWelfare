| 1                                 | Request for longer suspension     |
|                                   | after the agreement is terminated |
|                                   | – part 1                          |

|                                   | Payee Mary and Payer Howard have  |
|                                   | a non-initiating child support    |
|                                   | agreement for their child Steve.  |
|                                   | Mary has 100% care of Steve. The  |
|                                   | agreement does not have a longer  |
|                                   | suspension clause.                |

|                                   | Child Support is notified on 22   |
|                                   | September 2018 that Steve moved   |
|                                   | to Howard’s 100% care on 20       |
|                                   | September 2018.                   |

|                                   | Following discussions with both   |
|                                   | parents, a care decision is made  |
|                                   | on 15 November 2018. Mary has 0%  |
|                                   | care of Steve from 20 September   |
|                                   | 2018 and Howard has 100% care     |
|                                   | from 20 September 2018. As it is  |
|                                   | more than 28 days since Mary      |
|                                   | ceased to be an eligible carer,   |
|                                   | the agreement termination is      |
|                                   | pended for 28 days until 13       |
|                                   | December 2018 while Child Support |
|                                   | contact both parents to see if    |
|                                   | they want a 26 week suspension    |
|                                   | period.                           |

|                                   | If contact with both parents is   |
|                                   | unsuccessful, end the agreement   |
|                                   | on 13 December 2018 for Steve,    |
|                                   | with effect from 20 September     |
|                                   | 2018. A formula assessment is     |
|                                   | payable by Mary to Howard for his |

|                                   | On 7 February 2019, Mary calls to |
|                                   | advise Steve is again in her 100% |
|                                   | care from that date.              |

|                                   | Child Support advise Mary that    |
|                                   | she will receive child support    |
|                                   | under a formula assessment from 7 |
|                                   | February 2019, because the        |
|                                   | agreement has ended. Mary asks    |
|                                   | for a longer suspension. Howard   |
|                                   | is contacted and also asks for a  |
|                                   | longer suspension.                |
|                                   |                                   |
|                                   | As the joint request was made     |
|                                   | within 26 weeks of 20 September   |
|                                   | 2018, the agreement is suspended  |
|                                   | from that date until 6 February   |
|                                   | 2019. A formula assessment is     |
|                                   | payable by Mary to Howard for his |
|                                   | 100% care of Steve, with effect   |
|                                   | from 20 September 2018 to 6       |
|                                   | February 2019. The agreement is   |
|                                   | restarted from 7 February 2019    |
|                                   | when Mary became an eligible      |
|                                   | carer of Steve.                   |

|                                   | formula child support is payable  |
|                                   | to Murray for that child under    |
|                                   | the child support assessment ($75 |

|                                   | 1 October 2018 when the agreement |
|                                   | is suspended for Ella. This is    |
|                                   | because the rate payable under    |
|                                   | the agreement will decrease from  |
|                                   | $300 per week for 3 children to   |
|                                   | $200 per week for 2 children, a   |
|                                   | change of more than 15%.          |

|                                   | week payable to Kylie for William |
|                                   | and Charlotte, offset by Kylie’s  |
|                                   | formula rate of $75 per week      |
|                                   | payable to Murray for Ella.       |

|                                   | Notional Assessment 23 days later |
|                                   | (on 24 October 2018).             |

|                                   | the portion of the total new      |

|                                   | payable to Murray for Ella is not |

|                                   | agreement, so no PNA or NA is     |
|                                   | applicable in relation to Ella.   |
|                                   | The FTB A paid to Murray for Ella |
|                                   | will take into account that the   |

|                                   | to Murray is Nil.                 |

|                                   | changed again, so no new PNA/NA   |

|                                   | 19 February 2019 before the end   |

|                                   | period. The care change was       |
|                                   | notified on 19 February 2019 and  |
|                                   | processed by Child Support on 1   |
|                                   | March 2019. The agreement for     |
|                                   | Ella restarts with effect from 19 |
|                                   | February 2019.                    |

|                                   | March 2019 when the agreement is  |
|                                   | restarted for Ella. This is       |
|                                   | because the rate payable under    |
|                                   | the agreement will increase from  |

|                                   | $300 per week for 3 children, a   |

|                                   | (24 March 2019). From 24 March    |
