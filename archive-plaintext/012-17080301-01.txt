This document outlines the process for assessing ROCS and ROCS/High Cost
Claim Indemnity Scheme (ROCS/HCCS) initial, subsequent and S38 response
applications.

ROCS applications

Eligible Medical Indemnity Insurers (MII) or Medical Defence
Organisations (MDO) must submit a ROCS or ROCS/HCCS application via the
Medical Indemnity Online Claiming (MIOC) system. In the event the MIOC
system is unavailable for a period of time (determined by the Director),
a ROCS or ROCS/HCCS application can be submitted with the relevant
supporting documentation, via post or email.

For more information on ROCS claiming see Medical Indemnity (MI) Schemes
Claiming.

The Resources page contains a ROCs overview, specialist codes,
attachments, forms and links to the Services Australia website and an
external website about MI.
