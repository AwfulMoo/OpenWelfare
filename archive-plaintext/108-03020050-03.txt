|                                   | persons was $50 000, then $50 000 |

|                                   | In exchanged care cases, each     |
|                                   | carer will need to qualify on     |
|                                   | their own, taking into            |
|                                   | consideration all of the          |
|                                   | income/assets of each care        |
|                                   | receiver individually when they   |
|                                   | are in their care.                |

|                                   | For example, Carer A is looking   |
|                                   | after care receiver X while Carer |
|                                   | B is looking after care receiver  |
|                                   | Y. If the combined income/assets  |
|                                   | of A and X are above the limit    |
|                                   | then Carer A will not qualify for |
|                                   | CP even if when the combined      |
|                                   | income/assets of A and Y are      |
|                                   | under the limit. This is because  |
|                                   | they do not have continuing       |
|                                   | qualification at all times. Carer |
|                                   | B may qualify if their            |
|                                   | income/assets, combined with      |
|                                   | carer receiver X and Y            |
|                                   | separately, is under the limit.   |
